0,wow..okay so i was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because i didnt read the dimensions before i bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size . this is about half the size of an ipod mini . it is by no means big . read the dimesions well before you purchase . the photos are really good quality and clear ..just small lol .
1,we originally got this to replace the " fan noise " in the winter due to our sons ' room being so cold . the first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it . we 've discovered it 's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night . with the adjustability dials it 's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan . it does n't however , cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly . would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise , especially for children
2,jeez , maybe i am getting old , but i really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest . a brilliant scientist . disfigured . angry . finds temporary techie fix for face . goes to get bad guys . fighting . more fighting . still more fighting . ex mate learns he 's alive . he leaves her anyway ( he 's too ugly ) . the end . more to come , if successful . not recommended
3,man , oh man , i think this is one of the worst books i 've ever read . if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars , i would ! seriously , half way through , i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was . boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive ! i found the book bizarre , unfocused and poorly written . the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused . the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation . the physics , engineering , psychology , medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic . characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome , only to have them dissipate . and so on . the characters do n't even seem like real people . for example , the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain , and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are . how could someone know a person that well , but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood ? or : one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them . c'mon , if the guys a nut ( and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking ' duck ' to them is nuts ! ) , write him as a nut the whole way through , do n't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book 's climax ! the book 's title is n't even explained , for crying out loud . thanatos means death in greek , i believe , but i could never understand what the author / editors / audience thought was dying . i wo n't read this one again , nor will i look for anything else by percy walker .
4,not the type of music i had envisioned...much slower than i was hoping for .
5,i thought this was convenient and easy to use . seemed to give a pretty accurate reading .
6,i 'm sorry i wasted the money . i can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it . i 'm not squeamish by nature , but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims , but animals as well . three quarter 's way through , when i realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end , i started skipping these parts ( which got me to the last page quite quickly ) . i was bored and disgusted with the author . i believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages . in the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much . this book is going on my " do not lend " shelf as i value my friends and would n't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense .
7,dave alvin 's sublime new cd is a cadre of songs written by californians either born and / or who grew up in this land . the lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises . it is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state . dave alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said " infiltrates your brain like a shot of jack daniels . " dave alvin says " we started with a list of 25 songs , from steve gillette to captain beefheart and everything in between . i was even thinking of doing ' going back to cali ' as a blues thing . in the end , though , it was n't about choosing my favorite songs so much as choosing songs that i could sing well enough and arrange differently enough to make them interesting . " he has picked these songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well . of them all , and i like each and every one , my two favorite interpretations are " here in california " and " surfer girl " " california bloodlines " is a sentimental rendition of john stewart 's fine work , which finds peace in knowing " there 's california bloodlines in my heart / there 's a california woman in my song ... and a california heartbeat in my soul . " " redneck friend " the jackson brown less well known song was just right for dave alvin 's style . " kern river " is a song merle haggard wrote after losing his best friend , and it is a melancholy rendition . " blind love " from tom waits is sung in a bluesy style with some doo wops thrown in to give it style . " here in california " one of my favorites is sung with christy mcwilson . he felt this song needed a woman 's perspective . " i 'm bewildered " is an old richard berry , the great guitarist 's tune . backed up by the calvenes . " sonora 's death row " written by blackie ferrell is a fable that examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a as gun fighter 's tale . " down on the riverbed " is an old los lobos song that is sung in dave alvin 's old blues style . " between the cracks " a song written by dave alvin and tom russell is a heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman , with a rollicking tune . this is the only dave alvin orignal song in this cd . " do n't look now " a song sung by john fogerty is an old creedence clearwater revival . bluesy and fun to make it dave's . " tramps and hawkers " by jim ringer is a delicate country waltz , come dance with me , bk . lyrics are wonderful . " loser " by jerry garcia and robert hunter , is darker with more infused blues than garcia 's version . it could n't sound less like a deadhead song . dave alvin put in a psychedelic section that is a tribute to the san francisco sound " surfer girl " brian wilson 's first song is done with doo-wops and again the calvanes did background . this is my favorite of dave alvin 's interpretations , and he sings this surfin'song with some tongue in cheek . dave alvin gives voices of california to this cd . voices from the california coastline and the surf music it inspired to the " brown earth of the state " to the frontier life and the lives won and lost . dave alvin had made his mark on this state , and the writers who loved their lives by writing and singing about the state they love . play it often and pay attention to the subtle influence of this cd . " california dreamin ' ? " highly recommended . prisrob 6-04-06
8,richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout ( along with partner emilio estevez ) of pretty madeleine stowe ( they have to watch her house through the night ) , and he falls in love with her . before the movie is over there 's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer ( aidan quinn ) . it 's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie , but the script is above average - especially the dialogue - and dreyfuss 's performance is right on target . a very entertaining movie ; definitely worth a watch
9,the only reason i 'm reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today . and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on . so.. . no , let 's be fair . i did enjoy analyze this , i really did , though it was n't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life , or even for the rest of the day . and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro ; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie . i did n't have very high expectations , though , because i rarely expect too much of sequels . once again , i was proven right . analyze that illustrates perfectly why ` sequel ' sounds like such a dirty word . the original film had a spark of originality ; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again . but of course , that could never work . it 's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel : those who have n't seen the original would n't understand the jokes , and those who have already heard them before . and that is why they fail time after time . so what does this movie have ? a great comedic duo , a couple of really funny guys . yeah , and ? fathers ' day had an even better pair , look what happened to that . a couple of good mafia jokes ? sure , sure . i even cracked a smile on several occasions . but that is n't enough . there are thousands of comedy films out there ; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable , and producers think they 'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas . newsflash : think again . nobody watches these movies . there 's no reason to when you can just watch the original again
10,these items are neat little towelettes that come in their own attractive and useful plastic container . they are very handy , and work wonders for insuring cleanliness . personally , i sure wish i had had these when my first two children were small . on the down side , flushing these things *can* result in plumbing problems , as i experienced . apparently , if your sewer line is relatively new and clear , they should give you no problems . but , if your system has any place in it where things can collect , you will face problems . according to my plumber , toilet paper begins to break down quite quickly , but these towelettes can take over a month to do so . ( my house was built in 1916 ! ) so , overall , i do like this product , and i recommend it . i just recommend that if you live in an older house , that you do not flush them
11,i in 1996 i bought and read all the pretty horses first . laughed myself off the train seat in to town . bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading pretty horses on the way . along with scenes from the orchard keeper , sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas , flavours , jokes , and a personality that i 'd rather see more of . sutree made me feel that i know this man , and could even like him . great fun , and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading .
12,melrose larry green 's book is full of quotes . quotes and information used to back up points are good things . he appears to have researched by surfing the internet , watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others . this is all fine and acceptable . the problem with " why the clintons belong in prison " is when the author ( cut and paste expert ) attempts his own narrative , which is sporadic , jumpy and poorly edited . his points are not linear , and show the author 's attention deficit . with a proper literary team , this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a " hit and run " report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program .
13,i bought this camera for myself at christmas . it is my first digital camera purchase . i love the clarity of the pics . i love the shutter speed ! i do wish the lens cap would stay on better , but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera .
14,if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt , you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor . if you love the fish eye style and have that camera , you 'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip . i was disapointed with this lens for that reason . the sigma 8mm is great . a note to the reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones . this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy . it happens often enough with sigma gear . with this lens , its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want . bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out . decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy . i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge . sounds like you got a bad one
15,hi , i bought this camera and installed the driver from both the cd and then the web . it caused my computer ( a good , modern , fast computer ) to crash both times . the camera worked without interfacing with the computer , but , then , what 's the point ? also , the pictures and movies were very grainy and low quality . the tech support when i had these problems was horrible . they really did n't stand behind the product at all and to me that 's the most important thing ! maybe i could have gotten it to work , but not without some input from aiptek . i 've never written one of these reviews before , but this really got to me . do n't buy this camera is my advice .
16,my wife had high bp , so we got this model . the reasons for choosing this model were that : 1. the upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate 2. it was cheaper than the fully automatic models 3. omron seems to be one of the better / best brands . 4. supposedly , the pumps on the fully automatic models are prone to breaking . the unit appears well built ( including the hand pump ) . it is easy to operate , and it seems very accurate . we checked its readings with an fully manual unit that we have at home , and the automatic unit at the drug store . we find it takes very accurate and consistent readings . people with physical limitations might find the hand pump inconvenient . also , people with a big arm might need to buy the larger cuff . i 'm overweight right now , so the cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife 's nicely ( it was bought for her )
17,the software installation is buggy . it try 's to download the entire installation from the snapstream web site , even though there is a installation disk included . if your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall windows . i have windows xp sp2 with a flakey internet connection . although i am computer literate , after two attempts to install this product i have chucked the whole thing out the window . p.s. snapstream has no tech service department to speak of
18,it is easy to mount and puts out a surprising amount of ligh
19,first of all , microsoft needs to come down on their prices ( not that this will ever happen ) . i build computers for a living , and i 'd say that 9 times out of 10 windows is the single most expensive piece of any pc i build . that being said , xp has come a long way . service pack 2 has done wonders for security . i also found it is the most stable version of windows i 've used to date . that 's not to say it does n't have it 's flaws . it still lets in it 's share of " germs " , stops responding from time to time ( hangs ) , and it 's very slow to shut down . the built-in cd writing software is terrible and remote desktop is not always a pleasure to use either . however , the biggest problem i 've had so far is with product activation . as a pc technician , i 'm always testing new parts . the most annoying problem i 've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes ( let 's say you replace a video card , a hard drive and add some memory ) all within a certain period of time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time . it makes you call microsoft , where you have to convince the representitive that you 're not trying to steal from them . then you have to read them a long number ( i think 41 digits ) and then they 'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in . it 's driven me to the point of using windows 2000 again to test my parts , even though this is n't always practical for testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel that i paid too much for this operating system .
20,just bought this showerhead i have a stand -up shower built in with a pull around curtain . all other heads blow the curtain out and water on the floor . this is the one . it works great . i have a shallow well pump with 40 -60lbs of water pressure setting . my wife loves this so much i will get one for her up stairs full shower bathtub
21,the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason : the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . for instances , his endless digressions about history , politics , and philosophy . for the movie , we are left with nothing but plot and character . ok , what is one to do ? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought : i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie . this is a slow film . it takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it . i ca n't recommend the film
22,very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery
23,the new office 2007 is completely revamped from older versions and is well worth the four year wait . + 's 1.new interface with improved accessibility to all features , you can reach all the features that were hidden away inside those menus and no need to memorize the menu contents / options . 2. if you are a developer you can write your own custom panes using visual studio . 3. great plug-ins ( like the save as pdf / xps thing available as a free dwnld ) , massive clip-art / template library . -s 1.overpriced by about 40%. somwhere around 250-300 wud have been the right price for the pro edition . 2. some backward compatability issues with the document formats and templates and does n't work with adobe acrobat as of now
24,but the stitching was irregular on the front . i thought the company produced good products , but i was mistaken when i bought this item . next time i 'll just go to bestbuy for a camera case
25,this product is worthless . save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else . i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank . i 'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in
26,being a second generation member of this so called " cult " and having parents that went through the same situation as the author , i can say that he must have too weak to fulfill his duty to god and true parents...it 's very sad when a member must leave . by sacrifcing you are able to develop a stronger relationship with god . hope this helps. .
27,picked mine up used on ebay for $180. with the growth of the vr market everyone is dumping there old lenses . you can get a used one for a great price . this lens is great for the serious amatuer . i have taken some incredible pictures with this lens . the autofocus is a little slow and i have heard people complain about softness on the high end but i have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my d70 at 300mm . of course i shoot the photo on a tripod... . i have not experienced the softnes
28,i did not like this dvd at all . it requires too many props such as bricks , belts , towels , blankets , chairs , etc.. . each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations . as a beginner i find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention . i feel it was a waste of money and do n't recommend it
29,nice collection of the complete issues , though , of course , one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story , which is somewhat frustrating . and the earliest years are , of course , somewhat crude ( heretically , even the kirby artwork in the first year is ) . but very nice to have in an affordable edition , regardless of the flaws ( though best viewed with a large monitor
30,i bought this over the sony and i regret it . i get a tape eject error every time i try to rewind . i can only rewind at 10 second intervals before i get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again . that 's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape . many canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired . canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item . i will never buy canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem
31,three six mafia has out done there self with this new guy chrome about every song is decent which is hard to find these days
32,it does the basic job well . the calibration runs smoothly and accurately . hardware looks and feels solid . my two completely different brand , size and age crt monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side . user interface is merely adequate . pop up help instructions are better than many i have seen . you will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work ( the hardwired buttons on the monitor , not software ) . in order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you can use " back " within the calibration , sometimes you must start over . also the separate " profile chooser " utility software , has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier . you can see it with windows display properties , but it may not appear in the profile chooser list . dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version . yes , it does dual monitors , but with an asterisk . it will create separate profiles , but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards . if you have a single video card with dual outputs , it will load the same profile ( the last one you created ) to both monitors at startup . this quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk ( and blames windows for the problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material , catalogs , or on the box . fortunately there is a work around ( not documented ) at least with my particular video card and running xp . after windows opens , you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor . you may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default . once it 's all set up , running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure , but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles . and check it after you open the application . i 've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time .
33,i bought the dvd for my collection after watching the film on tcm . the musical perfomances are terrific . upon receiving the dvd , i was very disappointed in the quality of the dvd production . the dvd states digital sound , but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on tcm .
34,i 'm very disappointed in this book , although some information in it is valuable , it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover . it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find ideas for what you need . although broken into sections , they are not readily found or visible . one must search the information needed as in a research assignment . the reproducibles are mainly for elementary grades . this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it 's contents , on-line . although the price was reasonable , i 'm not pleased with the way the book is organized & amp ; printed
35,not seeing many reviews , i 'm writing this as a warning . this mic is horrible . i bought it to get rid of the & quot ; motor noise&quot ; from my canon optura pi , as many others have . when i listen now , the sound is much worse . you can barely hear people speak over the loud humming.. . this mic is horrible
36,after owning three other canon cameras i am through with canon . all my other cameras were fine . this cameras lcd broke within the first month of normal use . never dropped ! all of my other digital cameras held up for years . ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen . never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times . this is a product defect / design flaw and canon will not cover it under warranty . $150.00 to get it repaired and it will happen again , or you may start getting the e18 errors . this is a expensive paperweight ! poor design . very dissapointed . i will never buy another canon product again
37,nice cd cool beats songs like welcome to atlanta pick it u
38,the mac os , $129 list , often cheaper , does n't get viruses , worms , malware , etc and probably runs all the software you do on a pc , with the exception of some games . go to a mac store and try it for yourself
39,i really liked this product . easy to follow and you feel it everywhere . i try to do it everyday . my clothes are looking better on me and i have had to buy some new ones . one of the best choices i ever made
40,this cd is so awesome , it stays in my cd player and i have recently added it to my mp3.
41,the hard-copy of britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries , now you can have all of that , with video , audio , tons of photos , and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original . for what you get , it 's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library
42,i 've had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well . i 've worn out 3 norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase i thought . this razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it . i have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart , but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave , and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face . i 'm going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift
43,do n't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package . it is the full version ready to be installed . do n't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start . so far , i have not noticed a dime 's worth of difference from the pro version . it is working great . however , the vista coupon shipped with my package expired on march 15 , 2007. additionally , the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between october 26 , 2006 and march 15 , 2007 , so do n't let the vista thing induce you
44,i live in south africa where the series appeared 20 years ago.thanks to amazon i was able to relive the wonder of archie bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family , each of whom is brilliantly cast.i have series 3&4 and now want 1&2.do n't wait any longer , 24 episodes of absolute delight await you
45,i am a huge john grisham fan . i believe the first grisham book i ever read was " the pelican brief " . after that , i was hooked . i admit that through the years mr. grisham 's work has become less " grishamisc " and not as entertaining as earlier works . but , you 'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does . i first started this book by listening to it on cd . i soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it . i was right ! the book starts out with action and pulls you in . the action barely lets up through the entire book . this is a different kind of action . more mental than physical . there seems to always be something going on and grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter . one thing that is very different about this book than most of his works , is that there is n't really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve . generally , we find grisham leading us to a thriller ending . however , in this book , it is more of a life lesson about greed . there is no bad guy , nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character , etc. the book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life . the characters are likeable and easy to follow . there are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story . i found the book very easy to read and follow . i always wanted more . although the book has a different theme than most grisham books , i still really enjoyed it . it reminded me why i like to read his books so much . it proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending . if you like this one , try the eariler works as well . if you have seen the movies , it does n't matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way . this book would make a good movie , but we 'll see if anyone in hollywood agrees with me on that point . happy reading
46,i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist - up - and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
47,the optical x6 zoom on the canon a710 is is already better than cameras in it s range ( i.e. non slr ) . however , the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size ; the tele converter lens really does make a difference . firstly , if there are any negatives , they are very minor ; the lens and adapter are black - would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera . erm , that 's it ! the main quality of canon is the lens , which they always do well . the clarity of this lens is very good , with very little fuzziness at the edge . it also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected . the electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment . the tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want .
48,it works very well . i bought it for my wives calves . she has thick ones and after working out it become more thick . using this product , her calves become soft and getting thin . i 've used it too , i can relax with it because it helps the blood circulation .
49,i have had this camera since jan ' 05 and have so far taken approximately 10 , 000 shots while on trips and at weddings . do n't expect much from it and you will be happy . as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions . i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving . cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well . battery dies fast . the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in raw mode . i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike . so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . the viewfinder is very dim . when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder . in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus . autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . when shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus . the 420ex flash is supposed to " talk " to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . however , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over / under exposed . after about five months , the shutter button started sticking . i would click it and then it would remain depressed . the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little . another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . and since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . for example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person , it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos . but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere
50,first of all , ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do . ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina . tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like " all the others . " ike took advantage of her . tina her self said she cared very much for him . cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him . even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened . tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career , she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on . so she released her autobiography in 1986 , well after her come-back in 1984. while ike can try to deny it all he wants , the truth is he violently abused tina ! and considering the person ike turner is , i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back ! !
51,this is going to be a great program that will benefit our family in producing fantastic photos and films
52,i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it . the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out ( displaying blue and green pixels ) . i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all . overall do n't waste your time and money
53,great movie and musical numbers courtesy of quincy jones and the wonderful cast .
54,broke after two uses , buttons are hard to switch , and drying time was not better than my old-school model . in fact , my hair was frizzier . i was kinda glad it broke . i wish i had read the reviews before i bought this
55,if you can actually get the picture to turn out right , it does take pretty decent pictures . most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy . it also only holds about 5 pictures , so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot . i was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars , and it does n't really seem worth it
56,clean and crisp . defined and smooth . i use burberry by burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening . it has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn . i am very picky about my fragrances and i only use two regularly - - eau d'issey by issey miyake is my main scent , but i do use burberry sometimes on occassion and i love it . thats it
57,i own a swiffer wet jet , and i am sorry i wasted my money . i do n't know how effective this is on other surfaces , but i use it for my brazilian chestnut hardwood floors . along with the cleaning solution that swiffer markets for hardwood . i use this product exactly as instructed and my beautiful hardwood floors costing over $40 , 000 come up with smears and smudges like you would n't believe . i realize that this is a cheap quick fix for dirty floors , but when you add in the fact that you contnually have to buy pads and cleaning solutions , it really is n't all that inexpensive the only thing this product has gong for it is it 's convienence , and technically , since i have to go over all of the floors again after using it to get rid of the smears and smudges , it really is n't that convienient either . so really this product is a big dud for hardwood floors at least .
58,let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie . 1. it is incredibly beautiful animation 2. the music is amazing 3. i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i do n't like about the movie : 1. the characters are not developed at all 2. you get the feeling your only skimming the surface , like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process . ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 , well that is becuase of the story line and plot.the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation . the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end . i just kept thinking there has to be more . but there wasn't . the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just could n't find its parents . this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff . but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please do n't buy it rent it first . i 'm not saying its a bad movie by any means , just a bit empty for me.just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good do n't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series
59,i 've used adobe products for years and years and will continue to do so
60,i get this stuff for my husband . he 's got really thick hair and it has the tendency to get oily but this stuff makes his hair perfectly soft and shiny . it 's worth the money
61,i used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it . boy are they right . this thing is terrible . after installing on windows xp sp2 , as soon as i started the program it crashed . now every time i try to scan using my canon scanner , it crashes every time . product is useless . wish i had of never bought it ! do not buy !
62,the oral b eb417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places , reaching back teeth , removing plaque , has a nice gum massage action , and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed . the two heads work twice as good as one , but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head . using it by gently guiding it over your teeth , and letting it do all the work , it will last a long time too . it was nearly three months before i had to replace mine . most oral b brushes are interchangeable with all oral b units . this one though , according to the buying info here , may not be used with the cross action brush . it will also indicate when it 's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles . ( the box shows as good picture of new and used ) . just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too ! it 's a 5 star product , but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out , the better buy would be to purchase the three pack . it 's almost like getting one free . my pack also came with different color rings , that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart . it 's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well . keep smiling....laurie
63,save your money . does'nt bill already have enough of it ? i wish bill had to pay us for all the wasted time and headaches . do n't worry , for a few dollars more you can fix it . what a racket
64,system mechanic 6 professional is an excellent product and it solved all the problems i was having with my computer . it also alerts you of impending problems . i highly recommends this product .
65,i purchased the axion 10.4 " frame for my wife to replace a defective polaroid frame from a different source . the axion stacked up quite nicely to the other " more expensive " frame . the axion is viewable from more angles than the polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag . quality of the display is better on the axion and we have not had any technical issues . pros : brightness control color and contrast of display ease of setup and operation good sound from speakers on music playback cons : slide show transitions are from top to bottom only . different transitions would be a nice feature . remote does not control volume of music . overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages . we have been very happy overall with this purchase
66,this book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field . one may not necessarily agree with prof . leveson 's views ( e.g. her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering ) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored ! the book is a good " bed time reading " that gives an overview of the field , major problems and introduction to some major approaches . it is however not a handbook per se - you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it . overall , very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language
67,does n't work on coarse hairs . does n't remove , only trims . okay for fine light hair- -of course , if you have fine , light hair , you do n't need to try to remove
68,always lively and perspicacious , this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle : while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations ( weapons , diseases , horses , etc. ) for why europeans spread so thickly into north america , australia , new zealand and argentina ( the lands crosby labels " neo-europes " ) , what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well ? the question does n't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion , but the european housefly , and feral pigs , and a horde of other weeds , pests , crops , diseases and livestock from europe followed suit . quite often these organisms , even the domesticated ones , raced ahead of european explorers themselves , rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom . why was this so ? why did n't , say , australian weeds , their seeds inadvertently shipped back to england , eventually carpet the meadows and fields of europe ? to answer this odd question , professor crosby begins his story with pangaea- -the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe . these " seams of pangaea " then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet , and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when european mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams . crosby details case after case in each category : weeds , pests , livestock , diseases and crops . he forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear . what is the answer ? he drops clues every now and then , and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters : if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans , then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all . here , then is the answer : all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the european diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the old world civilizations- -and they , in turn , furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium . together- -humans , horses , cattle , pigs , rats , clover , peaches , measles and , yes , dandelions- -comprised a potent self-replicating system , dimly discerned by its contemporaries , that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of pangaea
69,i thought this was a great product . it 's like having your own guitar instructor , but even better . you only have to pay once and you get hours of instructions you can use for as long as you want . also , you can use it any time you want without having to make a trip . i 'm pleased with my purchase . you will be too
70,now , i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person - - in fact , probably more than the next person , since the average " next person " has n't ever read any . tales of derring-do , adventures to unexplored distant lands , lost civilizations , great artifacts , etc. - - that 's all good stuff . what 's not good is this book , which is tedious in the extreme . on the surface of it , haggard 's followup to his hugely successful ( and infinitely better ) " king solomon 's mines " has all the elements : a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers ( one of whom is descended from pharaohs ! ) , a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man , an expedition to africa , and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life . however , despite this promising laundry list , haggard 's execution leaves a great deal to be desired . a friend described it rather aptly as " a book with a lot of story , but not a lot of plot . " which is to say that in my edition , some 320 pages are filled without much happening . there is the initial mysterious set-up , the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations , the heroes ' conveyance to the " lost city " , and then.. . and then things kind of grind to a halt . lengthy descriptive details , lengthy internal ruminations , lengthy rambling speeches , lengthy everything - - but very little of consequence occurs until the very end , when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life . i suspect much of the problem stems from the book 's origin as a long-running serial in the gazette . as i understand it , serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment , and thus , it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible - - hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words . judicious editing could reduce the book to 1 / 3 of its size without any loss of note . of course , as another friend pointed out , it 's probably best to read the book is small chunks - - just as one would have done with installments . spreading out one 's reading of it over a period of time , he suggests , may serve to conceal the book 's rambling nature . in any event , there are some nice scenes here and there , such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches , but those are about all i 'm likely to recall from this book in a year . of course , as is noted in the introduction to my edition , haggard lifted the main elements of the plot , and even the the true name of " she-who-must-not-be-named " , from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer-lytton , so one ca n't even give him much credit for imagination . i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen : racism , anti-semeticism , misogyny , fear of miscegenation , etc. , but as entertainment for the modern reader , it falls woefully short of the mark .
71,i have tried a gazillion of these " diet " protein bars . this is the only one i 've actually found so far that tastes good .
72,all-instrumental collections of bluegrass are hard to find , and if you like it when a band takes a break from singing and just plays their instruments , here 's your chance for total immersion . all the songs on this compilation are from rounder records albums released 1976-1998 , by artists with familiar names like alison krauss and tony rice , and others you may never have heard of . all are first rate , foot stompin ' renditions of bluegrass traditionals , with a few great originals - - bill monroe 's & quot ; bluegrass breakdown&quot ; and earl scruggs ' & quot ; foggy mountain chimes . &quot ; best known for most listeners is a rousing version of & quot ; orange blossom special&quot ; by the johnson mountain boys . if you like bluegrass with plenty of pickin ' at breakneck speed , this cd will keep you smilin ' through many , many replays
73,i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations . in chapter 5 , he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly . he says the value of c ( t ) must be infinite or nonzero , but doesnt bother to show why . this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions . its not all bad , but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it . i have read good textbooks , this isnt one of them .
74,as if this set could be anything but five stars ! ! ! barbra streisand - four of her films on their dvd debut - her own commentary - oy vey ! order it now and plan a vacation day for the day after you get delivery
75,i have an r717 camera . i bought the dock too . each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical . hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera . the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera . i bought a " clone " battery ( not hp ) and its edges are rounded too . maybe hp could explain the difference . just thought you would like to know
76,i 've had this book since 1997 and i still refer to it for ideas . it has such a unique and diverse pictorial on each page by ' grand ' and ' credible ' photographers . for anyone who takes pictures...likes pictures...this book is a must get for you . i have it on my coffee table and i get rave comments on it all of the time about what a great book it is
77,since sunset boulevard is one of my favorite films , i bought the london cast album long before the musical came to america . patti lapone is the ultimate broadway star , having created the role of evita . her soaring versions of " as if we never said goodbye " , and " with one look " are unmatched . her power and vocal range soar ! all of norma 's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate glen close 's lack of , ( or nonexistent ) singing ability . in fact , this dvd was unavailabe to the american market during the american run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves . perhaps alw did n't want the american audience to hear the masterwork of this production . kevin anderson , a brilliant actor , does not have the operatic quality of alan cambell in the u.s. cast , but he portrayed joe gillis with far more guts and passion . this is not for the lover 's of oklahoma of showboat , but for lovers of more contemporary musicals , this one is perfect
78,i had bought this heating pad previously for an elderly cat because it did not have automatic shut-off and it works wonderfully . i just bought another one for our sickly kitten and they have added an automatic shut-off valve that they do not mention in the product description ! i wanted a heating pad without automatic shut-off ! i can get a heating pad with an automatic shut-off anywhere
79,i ordered this item for my husband and i was extremely disappointed . it is poorly made and basically is not worth the money . i do not recommend it at all
80,i was , overall , disappointed by this cd . there are many good reviews here , but they generally overpraise . tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears . a major highlight is track 9 , the crab and the egret , but interestingly , the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous chinese percussion . disappointingly , the cd is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment
81,yes it is pricey but worth it . i tried the gilette skin care and liked it . at that point , $5 bucks for 1.7 ounces felt crazy . so when i bought this i thought i must be mad . but for my skin it works fantastic . it also has the distinct advantage of how it dispenses . you get a controlled amount unlike a tube by pressing down on the top . yes you can not see how much is left . but i have had tubes that are not clear and you are in the same boat . at least here you have the best possible non-clear dispenser you could get . i have always had good skin so i do not need that much to have good results . it is not greasy nor does it have much of a fragerence . it leaves my skin feeling smooth and has made shaving easier and smoother . probably the q10 is a bunch of hype . and yes i usually buy sauve or ' swiss formula ' which are much less pricey . i can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces . under $4 a month to feel great and help protect my skin ? worth it to me
82,joe versus the volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that 's romantic enough for girls , funny enough for guys , with effective visual symbolism , and appropriate for the whole family . maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life , or something like that , but at any rate it 's pleasant to watch , at times profound , at other times funny . the beginning 3rd is about joe ( tom hanks ) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy , really crummy job , primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical ( oppressive ) supervisor ( dan hedaya ) . ( i 've been there myself , when i worked at pines mfg h&h tooling and again at toro , where everyone was on dope . ) joe learns from his doctor ( robert stack , of the untouchables ) that he has a " brain cloud " and only a few months to live . the tone of the movie rises as joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that 's ever happened to him . he takes a former co-worker ( meg ryan ) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time . the next day billionaire lloyd bridges ( airplane ) enters joe 's life with a bizarre proposition : since he 's dying anyway , why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire 's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime . joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur ossie davis ( the client ) and the billionaire 's two daughters - both played by meg ryan ( sleepless in seattle ) , which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie , making it even more pleasant to watch
83,the monitor works really well . the functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking . if you are looking for a good basic monitor , this is a great unit .
84,after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory , this sequel was an absolute let-down . the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie 's ( formerly wonka 's ) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth . while beyond the reaches of earth 's atmosphere , our heroes- --charlie , grandpa joe , and mr. wonka- --must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids ( pronounced " k'nids " ) , aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes . far worse than these beasties , though , are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless . charlie , joe , and wonka , with no help from charlie 's folks or other grandparents , save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory , where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills , returning them to infancy or beyond . charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites , who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters . at the end of the novel , the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president . in short , these three are the most tedious , spiteful , unredeemable characters i 've come across in children 's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book . as it is , they ( unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory ) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last . their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore , rather than a joy , to read .
85,i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try . i am happy with all of the tracks . some tracks remind me of beatles a little , but not all , so the band does have a unique sound . even though from the 90s , the sound is like many bands making it today . i like it .
86,the new systemworks has a horrible interface . you ca n't see what your options are easily . you ca n't see the status of your components . you ca n't see what version you have . when you load it after loading norton personal firewall 2006 , the firewall will not load program rules ( you have to uninstall the firewall and then reinstall it ) . i 'm not sure how the protection works , but the software " redesign " was done by an ergonomic moron
87,pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... hold on ... let me start again . pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... dang it ! give me a few minutes here ... pinnacle studio can assist ... ( samuel l jackson-styled expletive ) ... how many times is this gonna happen ? start and stop ! start and stop ! enough already ! one more time . now , what was i saying ? oh , yeah ... pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running . got the idea ? just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the pinnacle products . this is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions . after installing the program , installing the patches , uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches , i am still experiencing too many crashes . if you intend to use this program to piece together a video of uncle morty 's birthday party , the family vacation or your neighbor 's kid 's bar mitzvah , the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness . if , however , your video projects fit under the category of " job description , " then i suggest spending the money for adobe premiere
88,wow.. . now if you really want to see a rip-off , here it is . not to be damaging to amazon.com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun . the hood is definitely not worth it
89,f this self-help industry crap . quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst . i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title . humans are far more complex than the hack man-warrior / female-maiden title what's -his-name gives them . and remember , this " doctor , " is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase . your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives , so why do you ? let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch . that 's a great start to a sane life
90,it 's good as my title says , however , i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off
91,the title says it all . they could have put a better group of songs togather
92,i tried reading it , and made it about 3-4 pages . i 'm pretty sure that 's a bad sign . i seem to recall mr . sedaris writing about his mother 's bedpan or something . the impression i instantly got was " beep beep ! pretentious young writer peddling so-called bad childhood experiences for fame , money and sympathy . " guess what , mr . sedaris ? i do n't give a ( expletive deleted ) about your so-called bad childhood . millions of people have bad childhoods and do n't play the sympathy card . check out augusten burrough 's books , they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style .
93," ils se marirent et eurent beaucoup d'enfants " ( " happily ever after " ) is a cleverly written examination of contemporary views on love , lust , marriage , infidelity , and the single life . writer / director / actor yvan attal has come up with a winner , an entertaining , funny , and ultimately thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering . three men work together in a car dealership . vincent ( yvan attal ) is the apparently happily married man with a beautiful wife gabrielle ( charlotte gainsbourg ) and child . georges ( alain chabat ) on the other hand is in a tumultuous marriage with nathalie ( emmanuelle seigner ) who has gender issues that go far beyond feminism and negatively influence their child . fred ( alain cohen ) is single , bedding every lovely woman he encounters , balancing trysts between mornings , afternoons , and evenings and is deeply envied for his don juanism . but fred actually longs for the sense of belonging that married men enjoy . the men 's lives intertwine on many levels . most important , we discover that vincent has a lover ( angie david ) despite his idyllic married life and while it is georges whom one would expect to seek solace from a lover , he remains faithful to his nagging wife ! gabrielle senses vincent 's affair and encounters a sexy man in a music shop ( johnny depp ) who begins to preoccupy her thoughts . she is a real estate broker and comes close to an assignation with a client but remains faithful . all the while she daydreams about her brief encounter with depp and satisfies her wandering eye with those memories . fred discovers that one of his paramours is pregnant and happily decides to leap into the married fray . the only ' adults ' sharing advice here are vincent 's long married parents ( anouk aime and claude berri in very welcome comeback cameos ! ) and it is this ' standard ' that adds the final humor to the film . the manner in which all three men deal with their living situations asks as many questions as it gives answers . attal finds joy in all forms of coupling and is careful to offer all sides of decisions his characters make in arriving at what provides them happiness . this is a smart movie with terrific twists . there is just enough slapstick ( an all out food fight between vincent and gabrielle - real life husband and wife team attal and gainsbourg - that proves to be one of the fun-loving bits of silliness that binds their marriage ) to keep the mood light . not a profound film , but a joyous french comedy handled by total pros ! in french and english with subtitles . recommended . grady harp , october 0
94,this book is packed full of incredible devices for any one who enjoys exalted . the book has a wealth of knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows . the book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses , that is the only way i can discribe it . there is a giant amount of artifacts that have nothing to do with combat , and then others that are . there is a section on warstriders , basicly single man " death machines " that basicly look like large metal robots . most of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have pictures that show you what they would more that likely look like . i do n't like saying that is what they look like because , well , this is rping people , things change by a player / gm 's perception . anyway , enough of my ramblings , this book rocks and has items that range from pens to armor to boots to royal class warstriders . this book is about gear in the world of exalted . p.s. it looks like there is going to be about 4 more of these books . my best guess is that one will be for sorcery , but that is just one book . if you think of anything else , post it here to give me some ideas on the other ones
95,i am realtively new to country music . i purchased this because i had the pleasure of hearing willie sing " you do n't know me " on cmt one afternoon . i was quite taken with his rendition and recalled hearing this song growing up . from this one time " soft rocker " i could n't be happier . go willie
96,having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series , the following are my suggestions . 1. read all five books in order . the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context . think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal . dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable . getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a 3 , 500 page experience . 2. read the oxford university editions . there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events . when you read 3 , 500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight . the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter . 3. if you really like any one book in particular , go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection . i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir . the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable . along with sir walter scott , alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel . i have been reading these types of novels my entire life . beyond a doubt , alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre .
97,before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to bill gates ' ' feed the multi-billionaire fund ' , do yourself and the world a favor and search for ' star office 8 ' on amazon and read the reviews there . i use ms office professional 2003 in the office , and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by microsoft for this bloat-ware . star office 8 is under $50 from amazon and is fully compatible with microsoft office , and includes full functionalities of ms word , excel , powerpoint , visio , and access . let me know what ms software i can buy under $100 , let alone $50. hopefully , this is the beginning of the end of the microsoft monopoly , and the dawning of the era of sanity in computer software .
98,julieta venegas did it again . she scored an album that is not alternative in style , however it is very catchy pop music . her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on . you can sing along and express day to day feelings . julieta continues to use instruments i like such as the harmonica . and of course , julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances . my personal favorite is " me voy " , a very positive song about a not so positive event , breaking-up . keep up the good work , julieta . your songs are appreciated .
99,this movie is pure fun . my whole family loved it . it 's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it 's amatuer hour , but its fun to watch . we made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing . watch it and enjoy
100,i purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag
101,i bought two of the mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed. class . i bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother ( caregiver ) passed away . the storyline of the game is that mia has to save her gravely ill grandmother . then she gets mugged by a rat ! i feel this is a little to noir for small children . the math game ( which i am returning unopened ) is about her house burning down , and if she could prevent it by going back through time . i feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects . i am returning both games
102,this is by far the best dictionary on the market . far better than merriam-webster 's outdated and obtuse dictionary , the american heritage dictionary is a dictionary for the 21st century . it is up-to-date , informative , pleasing to look at and browse . i would gladly pay full price for this dictionary . finally , i can discard my outdate m-w dictionary . what a joy
103,i found this product after reading a review of it on hairboutique.com . the length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer . i decided to try this product to see if it worked . as hair growth is normally clocked at an 1 / 8 of an inch per month , i decided to monitor the results in my own little " clinical test . " this was actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i 'd easily be able to see how much growth there was each month . i ordered a box of viviscal for which i paid $49 for ( average price on the web ) and the was set to take the first pill the following morning ( the box recommends 2 per day ) . i coloured my hair the night before so that in one month i 'd be able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by looking at the growth since the colouring . results : i did n't really notice anything until around the 2 week time frame . i noticed my nails were growing very fast / very long . i have weak nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all . it was very noticeable because i use the computer all day and the nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the keyboard . never having great nails , i was pretty happy to see this . my curiosity was also getting the better of me as i could see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at 2 weeks after coloring . i took the tape measure and measured almost 1 / 4 of an inch in hair growth . this would mean 1 / 2 inch per month and 6 inches per year . i was pretty excited because although the numbers seemed small , it was twice the rate my hair normally grows . but i also noticed something else . my hair was becoming unusually greasy . because i have very dry hair , i normally only wash it 2-3 times a week . but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal . hmmm. well , at the 1 month time frame i measured my hair growth and it was exactly 3 / 4 of an inch . not only that but i was constantly trimming my nails at this point . i was totally ecstatic . but also by this point , i was washing my hair every day - it was no longer dry and brittle , it was much softer , but there was no way i could miss a day of washing it or it would be greasy . so - the conclusions i have reached from my test was this : 1. yes , viviscal works . it caused my hair growth to be stimulated at over twice the speed . 2. viviscal also makes your nails much stronger and grow much faster . 3. viviscal makes your hair greasy , causing you to have to wash it every day - and then it 's fine . it did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else , which i thought a bit strange ( though good ! ! ! ) . i recommend this product
104,the is-dv only records videos in the ' asf ' format , not mpeg-4. i bought one from ' egghead.com' . after 30 days , i contacted aiptek to tell them the problem , they acknowledged that the is-dv only records videos in the ' asf ' format . they said there is nothing they will do about it . do not buy this product . aiptek advertises that the is-dv records video in mpeg-4 format , but it doesn't . ' egghead.com ' wo n't deal with me because they say i should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date
105,i love this product . i have thick hair and the ceramic plates are very wide wich allow you to staighten your hair quickly . does an awesome job
106,after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes & noble that same night . dr. whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions ! in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors . we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers . however , if at home you are on dr. whitley 's 10-step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system - the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front . although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation - the constant image of " mr. rogers " in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents . of course , that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he / she is capable of " frightening " resistance . obviously , professional help with someone in-tuned with dr. whitley 's methods would be more advisable than his book ! to me - this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less - and possibly 7-8th graders . these kids still have some moldability and are n't as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem ( i.e. depression ) . for the grammatically correct - the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author ; 0 )
107,i agree with others who said it crashes the system . overall , i found ss6 pro had more problems than it was worth- -even if it were free , it 's not worth all the time and effort . besides all the crashes , downloading the virus / spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 to 1 1 / 2 hours . be forewarned . in the end , i returned my copy to vcom , though to date i have not yet received a refund
108,no a very good video . poor quality . hard to follow . very much a cheat copy of the movie gettysburg .
109,the filter is small compared with most other systems ; has a sturdy , metal fixture and pull-knob activator ; filters quickly with plenty pressure ; and of course it has the great culligan taste
110,the first was one of the best thrillers ever , with clever suspence , good characters , decent acting and awesome effects . this one is.. . meh . why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video series ? what 's the bloody point ? now there are some good parts . the rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent , but you know , that does n't even save it . this movie is a annoying , pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love . it is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke . the characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs . i do n't even know them well . all they do is scream , run around in the cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut . i also really hate the effects in this one as well . they felt like they were over-used . there is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was . the direction is ok , but when it comes to adding wierdness , it 's too much . i do n't understand the story , there 's a strange sex-scene which a cube movie does not need . cube is about suspence . this one is just about adding too much effects , a four-dimensional cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one . you do n't need that stuff . if you wanted to make a sequel better than the first , add something original , do n't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original . but no , you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it 's a cube movie , you do n't need nudity . overall , if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap , go ahead . i know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes . if you 're a fan of cube , dont ' bother . acting : 3 / 10 ugh , do n't get me started . these actors have bad acting skills and i hope they die . gore factor : 4 / 10 cgi gore ? ! come on ! ? t&a : 1 / 10 a cube movie does n't need nudity and they do n't know that because they do n't know cube . direction : 7 / 10 andrzej sekula did have some visual eye in some parts . i did enjoy a few scenes and i dug the rooms , but you know , i ca n't say he 's a great director . he turned the franchise with straight-to-video written all over it . bottom line : if you wanna watch , go ahead , then you 'll be sorry . this movie is just sad . it does n't try anything to impress you because it 's idiotic . lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again
111,i 've found the recipes here generally simple and easy to make ahead . mrs. burros is very clear in her instructions ( although i had some problems with a chocolate roll ) and the taste combinations are very good . as this book is an update of her original there are a number of amusing asides on changes in food ingredients and cooking styles between the two editions . not quite a & quot ; must-have&quot ; but useful
112,the remote control works well with the olympus digital camera . it was delivered on time and without any problems .
113,i am a big fan of the regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs and think they are great . however , the sport goggles do not get my vote of confidence . they have three problems which make them unusable for me : 1 ) on all clic products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head . however , unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by clic , the sport googles do not adjust properly and so the goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there is also extra foam padding on the sport googles that make them very snug , but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3 ) the maker does n't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the irridium ( red ) colored lens on some of the sports goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path . sorry clic , but your success with the reading glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the sports goggles . i would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me !
114,i 've purchased other bags but this one beats all & it was a great price to
115,the sunday philosophy club , and the other 2 titles in this series by john mccall smith , are everything the fans of mme ramotswe would hope they would be . leaving botswana was hard , but now we are in edinborough scotland , and isabelle dalhousie is as wise and vulnerable and real and wonderful as her african predecessor . it is a miracle that a man can write his women characters so believably and so lovably . it is another miracle that anyone can write such absorbing , cozy , engrossing books . this is good literature and good fun . the sunday philosophy club along with friends , lovers , chocolate , and the more recent the right attitude toward rain , are too wonderful to miss . welcome to scotland
116,saw " hart 's war " the other night and could n't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one . this film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days . here are ten reasons why : 1. this film is n't " the great escape " and even though he would probably like to think otherwise , bruce willis is n't steve mcqueen . even though willis received top billing , this is a colin farrell vehicle . 2. the vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the reagan administration , much less world war ii . " hart 's war " may just as well be a film about a pow camp during the war of 1812. anything with vin diesel or the rock would be bound to sell more tickets . 3. as far as depicting life in a pow camp , " hart 's war " is pretty much on par with " hogan 's heroes " . the germans are nice guys with guns who do n't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything . where did the gi 's get all those cigarettes , anyway ? 4. any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him . as depicted in " hart 's war " , the camp commandant ( as portrayed by marcel lures ) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army . his collection of american jazz / blues records is a cute writer 's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation , or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps . in reality , the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic . 5. the storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in pow camps , one good example being the pow 's who were tried and hung in andersonville ; however , the whole idea that the camp 's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous . 6. the idea that during the trial , a group of pow 's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting . not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii , it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions . the german army simply was n't that stupid . 7. i saw this film once and did n't like it . i thought that maybe the second time would be better . it wasn't . 8. beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness , " hart 's war " seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment . it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which , for most pow 's , was just day to day survival . also , the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans were n't spineless , hapless dopes . 9. bruce willis playing the same role in variations of " die hard " over and over and over again is tiring . 10. better films about the same sort of subject matter are " the tuskeegee airmen " and " stalag 17 " . hopefully in a few years , " hart 's war " will be completely forgotten , and these dvd 's will be rotting in some landfill .
117,just saw the video for this while flicking . the song talks about london bridge going down and everything but the bridge is fixed , it does n't go up or down with the video showing tower bridge . so bit of a mix up there . petty maybe but just thought it should be pointed out
118,excellent product my hair was striaght and dry in a matter of minutes
119,i heard from a number of people that amon amarth were an excellent death metal band , so with that in mind , i though i 'd try osftgh . what i hear , and it certainly seems i 'm missing out on something , is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting . just because you have mead dripping from your beard , and you scream out lyrics that contain , no mercy , vengeance and " it 's your time to die " does not mean you can create " authentic " viking / metal . these idiots could definitely take lessons from : enslaved , manegarm , falkenbach to name a few . do n't fall for the hype !
120,with the new year just more than six hours away , i must tell you that no matter a full moon , half moon , quarter moon , or no moon at all , please avoid the flick " darkwolf " for many moons to come . what a joke . what a silly , stupid , insult to one 's intelligence . the script could have been written by my dog stan...and even then , i give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine . let 's put it this way . have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much , you simply did n't give a ^ &^%* if they got blown away ? i was hoping the entire cast got mulched by mr. wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser . go " darkwolf " . take a few chucks out of this cast , its director , producer , writer and editors as quickly as possible...and do n't wait until the next full moon . " darkwolf " is an insult to motion pictures . more so , it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as " the wolf man " , " wolfen " and " the howling " , not to mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic " an american werewolf in london " . need i say more ? " darkwolf " has no bite . it 's claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion . the box claims this flick to be " half man . half wolf . pure evil . " in reality it is half / whole stupid . half / whole worthless . ...and...pure ^% &* ! get my drift ? at midnight...as we turn another page and the new year unfolds...i promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of " mary hartman , mary hartman " , much more than " darkwolf " . i 'm off to watch yet another new year 's flick before dawn . i need to make amends to lon chaney , jr. before midnight . bottom line , it was a film you did n't really care " where " the " wolf " came from , or where the werewolf was going . pitiful...embarrassing.. . " i 've seen the bad moon rising " but this one makes me wish it would set !
121,i was using this lense for a week now with d50 and i can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lense is awesome . at 1.8f this lense should be fast enough for any semi-profesional ( like myself ) . at 8f this lense produces the most sharpest photo ever and given that you shoot in nef ( raw ) format and use photo editor software ( i use nikon 's capture nx ) photoes become master pieces . at 22f , outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person . i highly recommend this lense
122,this os is not for any ordinary user . if you know nothing about drivers , peripherals , etc , then do n't get this os . lots of incompatability issues . i thought this os would make my gaming experience better , apparently it needs lots of work . ca n't play cs:s , day of defeat , lord of the rings online , etc. bf2142 and some other games play slower in vista compared to xp . i hardly write reviews , but i just want everyone to know that this os suxs ! stay with xp pro sp2. games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on xp . it is n't worth getting right now , wait a year or two until it gets worked out . feels like beta , which it shouldn't . microsoft , you get a f - for your new os . you fail . nice try
123,get off the drugs , guys . your reviews made me purchase this awful load of tripe . while proficient enough on the instruments and vocals , the moon falls woefully short just about everywhere else . the songs sound very similar to one another and are all pretty much void of any decent melodies or even a good hook or two . right when it seems they might be getting somewhere , they break the rhythm and make a feeble attempt to psych it up or out with a sitar , swirling strings or the ever constant and really abused minor key chord changes . there is also a curious lack of any decent choruses , here . i have to believe that that was a conscious effort on the part of the moon . bad idea , guys . and while the music is pretty lame , the lyrics are absolutely wretched . can anyone out there , after listening to this , remember more than ten words from any song on this washed out cd ? if you can , it 's because they 're so lame and uninspiring . the lyrics from the temptations ' " psychadelic shack " captures the feeling of the sixties better than anything these blotterheads came up with . here 's a big hint about the musical contents of this cd . it actually says on the front cover , " featuring david marks of the beach boys . " huh ? ? ? is that supposed to be a ringing endorsement ? comparing these guys to left banke , the zombies or the beatles is pure blasphemy ! for those of you fortunate enough to not have heard the moon before , count your lucky stars . if you feel yourself slipping to the dark side ( the boneheads giving this 4 or 5 stars ) and feel like spending some extra cash , there are other sixties groups more worthy of your money , like the aforementioned bands . i 'm probably going to piss some people off with this review , but that 's exactly how i felt after giving this cd a listen . honestly , i immediately thought of george harrison 's less than stellar second rate efforts while listening to this . i love ya george , but you put out more than one clinker of a northern song . if bad harrison 's your thing......well , then stop reading and buy this cd now ! for the rest of you , there 's a lot of music from somewhat obscure sixties bands coming out on cd right now . garage or psych , a lot of it is great , but the mine is also getting stipped pretty bare . the moon is proof positive . it 's also pretty easy to see why their recording company called it quits after two albums - and the second album is far superior to the first in both sound and content ! in closing , while this album has overwhelming intracasies layered into the music and vocals , the end product is very bland . i read these guys admitted to cutting these songs while under the influence of lsd . it shows ! i rated this " aural adventure " two stars , instead of one , for two reasons . first , i kept rooting for these guys to come up with a decent song to salvage the album ( actually two ) . they never did , but at least they performed all original songs . it 's also worth an added star to see a rerelease from a sixties band that does n't have a cover of " hey joe " on it . if you 're still with me ( and also a lover of good music or even mediocre fare ) , avoid this cd like the plague ! i 'd also like to thank amazon for putting this clinker on my recommendation lists . you done me wrong
124,ellen wright has done it again . this time , with meredith brokaw . and the two have combined to put together a wonderful array of recipes that are easy to follow and wonderful to serve to guests . often at my dinner parties i refer to ellen wright 's previous books . but now big sky opens a new door to cooking and presents inviting and simple recipes that will have your guests in awe of your skills . even for simple family meals , you will find yourself referring to big sky time and time again.. . i do n't know what i did before big sky was published . this is a five-star cookbook that everyone should have in their home .
125,i foolishly purchased 7.0. it worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system . funny , it started hanging up when 7.5 was released . i tried to get " customer support " but that 's a joke . do yourself a favor , do not buy anything from roxio . i 'd given this software negative stars if i could . spend your money elsewhere .
126,i purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that i was doing on wednesday evenings . i carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on amazon , hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that i could share in the study . unfortunately , this volume has n't lived up to my hopes . i did n't need something that would offer the obvious points ( i can do that myself ) . i was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages , including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today . i 've been disappointed . i am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as i 'm gathering information . i was between this one and the carson commentary . obviously , i think i made the wrong decision . ( not that there 's anything theologically wrong in the text - it 's just not what i was hoping for .
127,one star is too generous ! aaarrrgggh ! i am still mad about this book and i read it 3 books ago ! i loved ted dekker 's " three " and i enjoyed peretti 's children 's books i read with my kiddos , so i was looking forward to the arrival of a collaboration . but it was utterly silly ! if i start a book , i have to finish it . okay , that 's my own fault , but i had to make myself read this to get it over with ! i wanted to burn the book when i was finished to make sure nobody else i knew ever read my copy . the ending ? well , " shoo ! get out of here ! " was embarrassing ! shame on you , frank and ted
128,this movie is not a war movie . it is not remotely related to history either . guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history . since when did american troops in ww ii carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers ? this depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement . enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell ? can we spell bushido ? mallick can't . now , if you like touchy , feely , not the real world aesthetique , have at it . the scenery and photography is quite good .
129,all the great reviews written previously say it all - anne of green gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel . i 've been watching this movie since i 've been a child , and i still watch it as an adult . a movie like this does n't need " special features " for it to be attractive as a dvd ( although the commentary is great ! ) . just the fact that no matter how long i keep this and how often i watch this movie , it wo n't change like vhs does .
130,in the past , i have considered amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites . to be perfectly honest , i am no longer sure . two months ago , i bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on amazon . this camera set was called the 1 gb stylus 720 sw kit . ironically , the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 gb cards ! my first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories . two weeks after receiving the kit , i emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake . after waiting a few weeks for a response , i decided to send them a second email . again , no response . by this point , i felt helpless and turned to amazon for aid . surprisingly , amazon was not much better than 47th st photo . minutes after sending the email to amazon , i received an automatic email informing me that amazon had received my email . that was the last i heard from amazon . more than two months have passed and i have not heard from either company
131,so i did the unthinkable . i put windows vista business on my mac- -specifically my mac mini . it works great , no system slow downs and no crashes . the mac handles vista beautifully . i had no problems using boot camp 1.2 in order to install it . the mac drivers for vista ( included with boot camp ) all worked fine . the vista installation took all of about 30 minutes including some updates and such . i had windows xp home on my mac b4 and while it worked well , vista business works much more smoothly . as you may or may not know a mac mini is not exactly a powerhouse computer . i have a 1.66 gigahertz core duo with 1gb of ram on it . it displays the aero interface perfectly especially hooked up to my 32 inch widescreen lcd tv . seems even the lowest cost mac can still make vista shine while most pcs cant . one disclaimer tho . all intel macs can run vista ultimate without a hitch except the mac mini ( which can only go up to business / home premium ) while vista is still behind os x 10.4 ( tiger ) its a much better release from xp . now im just waiting to upgrade my little mac mini in october for the release of os x 10.5 ( leopard )
132,having just paid [...] for this product , i expected the word processing component to have at least the basics . wrong . to me , the ability to easily format a business or legal document with " page x of y " at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental . well , works 8.5- --unlike other microsoft word processor versions or programs- --does not provide that choice . without this basic a " feature " , you might as well simply use wordpad . i cannot comment on other abilities this program has or does n't have , or , on the spreadsheet or database modules , because i simply do n't want to spend any more time on this . recommendation : go to openoffice.org and get open office for free
133,these are great glasses , easy to put on and take off , and are there around your neck waiting for you to use them . i saw them on the csi ny coroner on tv and had to find some . amazon was the place to go
134,this is honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i love the first one but this one is just lame
135,this canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out , on a 1080p monitor . i have used other hdv format cameras , and they were much better . the low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain . if you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light , but still plauged in low light
136,if you need an experience of pure meaningless noise , this one 's for you . however , dont expect it to change your life much . the price listed above for the album is a very good example of the old cliche , " you get what you pay for .
137,o.g. ron c did a good job screwin ' & choopin' . he really gave the rest of tha u.s. a taste of texas ( tha lone star state ) . tha best time to listen to any screwed & chopped music [swishahouse , chamillitary , d.s.r. ( dirty south rydaz ) ] is you are throwed ( drunk ) off that syrup . this was a good thing that o.g. ron c did , choppin ' boyz up & not sloppin ' boyz up. chamillitary man ! !
138,before i bought the pasajes series , i was relieved to see the ( then ) mostly positive reviews . however , i really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very , very misleading . i would not , in good faith , be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish . this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with . some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish : 1 ) the concepts are not clearly explained ( they invented a " new " english word for one ) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary / concepts to feel confident using them . 2 ) frequently , new words , phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else , via a footnote , with no further explaination provided ! ! this is super frustrating and distracting ! 3 ) using this series of books is very cumbersome , the books are not well coordinated with one another , and do not appear to reinforce each other 's concepts or vocabulary . i 'm very sorry , but these books are just terrible , and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books.. . using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish , which i used to enjoy . if you have the option to use different books , take it
139,the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music . and do n't think that it 's good just because your kids might love it . kids also like to eat mcdonalds , but do n't try telling me that their food is healthy . there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children . and , surprisingly , a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children , even with the expletives deleted . there is no reason on earth why these records should exist , excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish . i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative . seriously , do n't buy this !
140,i chose office ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything i could possibly need to run a business , but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues . ultimate 2007 certainly does n't disappoint ! - set up was fairly easy : two disks came with the package . disk one contains most of the software and disk two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the accounting and key business functions . - ribbon technology removes the old " hunt and find " menu method ( although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up ) . - integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless . - excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon . - accounting software is included . - ink and crossword . i 'm not one for games on my business pc , but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords , ultimate lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords . - onenote . i like post-its ( perhaps a little too much *l* ) and always used the post-it note software on my business computer to keep notes . i used onenote 2003 sparingly because i simply found the post-it note software easier to use on my desktop , but...with my tablet pc one note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that i feel will work well with my business : the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality . i may still use post-it now and then for quick notes or perhaps the windows " stickys , " but the long note pages , pasting of images and other web info , and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable . - word . what can i say ? this is my primary software tool and i use it on a tablet pc . the 2007 applications were made for my computer type . i can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my wacom pen and i do n't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until i finish the document to then make my edits . - powerpoint , publisher , access , groove , infopath et cetera ( also included ) : i am still delving into these , but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs . so , did i have any dislikes ? 1. the ink program does n't respond to my wacom pen as well as the windows journal or microsoft onenote . it also does n't have easy to use tools within the software . since it was an " extra " and will not be my primary desktop publishing , design , or art tool - i 'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet . 2. microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program . as a result , after installation of the first disk and microsoft 's statement that all of my programs were installed , i could n't find my accounting software , had no idea that the accounting software was on the second disk ( the second disk , when loaded , does n't mention that the software is on the disk until after the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications ) , and wasted over an hour trying to find it . also , i 'm a " hands on " person and although i have access to the internet whenever i need it , i enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning . ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual is n't really necessary ( i.e. most questions can be answered by the " help " window ) , but...for the hefty price tag , i do n't think it would have been too much to ask microsoft to include a basic " this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect " booklet . also note : athough microsoft , through their downloads e-mail updates , provided a " getting started " tab with a " how-to " for each major software applications , the tabs had to be added " after the fact " and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software . beside those few quirks , i fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through amazon ( i.e. amazon 's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors ) . shipping turnaround with super saver : 2 days .
141,very good it does what i want and more . now to get more training on doing more with this produc
142,i was hoping to hear the rockin ' spanish flavor of the robert rodriguez band chingon , but what the hell is this ? ! ! ! the amazon recomendations lead me to this album , and hinde sight i should have read a little more before buying , but i was too excited to hear more of the rodriguez chingon . i hope this helps you
143,nice and compact . the tripod does n't really work as i expected . i am using my own tripod . overall is a nice little unit for the money
144,my sister have been uesing it since i bought it for her and i think she like it
145,i agree with the previous review . the deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out
146,i bought this product b / c i ca n't stand the feeling of hair / stubble on my legs . i got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave . this product indicated i could remove hair in about the same amount of time , but that it would last much longer than shaving . i purchased it and waited a week to receive it . once i received it , i spent 40 minutes using it . in this time , i could have shaved both legs , both underarms , and my bikini line twice . using this product , i was not even done with one leg . i went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period , and it did not remove a single hair . i pressed lightly , i pressed hard , i did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach , and nothing made this product work as indicated . others may have had luck with it , but i did not . i was not impressed and i would not recommend it to anyone .
147,this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock ! it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again... . it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time .
148,great recording , but if you want to actually use it , like load it on your ipod it has sony 's stupid drm . meaning you can't . do n't buy sony products ! !
149,okay , take everything that you know about john squire . strip away the amazing stone roses first album , the not so amazing follow up , the nice brit pop of his work with the seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and i honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically . they would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful , the vocals might be grating at first ( think robert forster ( the go-betweens ) circa before hollywood ) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving . what you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception . people should listen to it for what it is and not for what john squire was...john squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do ( who has n't moved on in 13 years ? minus robert smith of course ! ) and now writes beautiful pop songs...john squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that
150,the engine behind this program is from chief architect , who , from what i understand , are developers of professional cad software . it shows in this program . while this program has one of the best 3d walk around and capabilities , i tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses . and this one has some good usable tools . like most consumer level landscaping programs , this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home . unlike other programs , the bhg software allows you to import and mask your own plant images . this is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use . all the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there . for now , and with the choices i know of that are available to you , i find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there . this design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial cd . it was easy to install and start using right away . i think most folks would do quite well with this one .
151,if this movie was ever going to have a chance , it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long , or never attempted in the first place . some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - possession just ca n't be dealt with that way . what you have as a result is another story entirely . there just was n't time enough , i guess , to develop the characters , or even to include half of them . the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george . the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating , and we are left with painful stereotypes and , in the case of roland michell , a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming . my best advice is that if you 've read the book , skip the movie , but if you saw the movie , you should do yourself a favor and get the book
152,this gadget is a must-have for gadget lovers.....and picture lovers . it is compact , solid and fits any small pocket or clutch bag . the images are crisp if you get it set appropriately . if you love attention get this product and if you do n't .....not to worry the camera gets all of it .
153,dmx stars as the drug dealer king david , who pops up in the streets again after a long absence . rolling into the frame in a player 's classic - a late 70 's stutz blackhawk - king david shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life . he quickly reaps what he sows and , mortally wounded , passes all his worldly goods to paul ( david arquette ) , a scrambling white would-be writer . king david 's estate includes an audio journal of his life , which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken paul 's curiosity . it 's the highlights of king david 's high life that propel " alone . " like all of goines 's heroes , king david is a scourge on the periphery , and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity . every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit , and dmx signals that motivation with sly hostility . to say that king david is the best part he 's ever had is an understatement ; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before . i would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist
154,i have been a long time user of delorme products but decided to get a combination of microsoft products both for the us and europe ( autotrip ) . the program loaded very smoothly , but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the gps locator . there are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you do n't follow directions . i loaded all the data on my laptop so i would not have to carry the dvd . the setup was also quite simple . there are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use ( as well as the cautions during setup ) . one needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving . i set the mapping program and forget it . but it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate . the gps locator has a great chipset . very , very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds , even as i sit in my house . it rarely loses a lock on the satellite . the route finding works well , so far . you can save your track as well as the route , but unlike the delorme products you ca n't playback your track ( or if you can , i have not found it ) . the screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen . i have n't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average . the ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus . plus you can routinely update road construction sites . so far , no opinion on how good that feature is . the microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though i 've only tried it at home . it routinely thinks i 'm in china ( which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where i am ) . the gps also works with other programs by selecting a generic nema gps . there are other optional equipment to go with the gps . if you 've never used a gps mapping program with a laptop , microsoft s&t is a good choice . just do n't be surprised if the gps lcates you accurately and the microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet .
155,i was very disappointed that the version of & quot ; paper roses&quot ; included on this cd is an updated and new recorded version from 1990. it is not the original 1973 classic marie recorded when she was twelve.interestingly , this new version is produced by sonny james , the original producer of the original single , that also features many of the original studio musicians . so all is not lost . still , i prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this cd included an updated & quot ; paper roses . &quot
156,the soundtrack is great but some of the good songs from the movie arent on it . overall it is a good produc
157,thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low-budget .
158,i read all the reviews and comments on this kodak printer i could find . many gave glowing reviews . i 'd just purchased a new kodak digital camera , and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup . i was never able to get the printer to perform as kodak says it should . it caused some odd conflict , and my computer would not boot into windows xp with the printer attached to the computer . i ended up having to disconnect the printer , turn on my computer , and then reconnect the printer in order to use it . windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers . it was made even more frustrating by kodak 's tech support . i called and emailed multiple times for assistance . in one conversation i was literally told " i do n't know what 's wrong and ca n't help you . " now that 's tech support ! finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper . i tried all kodak 's remedies , none worked . no matter how much or how little paper was in the machine , it said there was no paper . i even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print . i ca n't recommend this printer . i could give a better recommendation had kodak itself , through its tech support , at least have provided my with some competent assistance . i got about 2 dozen prints , quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all . about the only positive i can give is that the prints i did get looked good , the color was nice . i gave it an extra star for print quality alone . kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time . it was synonymous with home photography once upon a time . they 've lost something over the years , and that is quality
159,great camera for the price . but i guess you get what you pay for , bad warranty.......... .
160,link this cd of great melodies with " the best of the browns ( 1954-1967 ) . you 'll not regreat the quality . such easy listening . this group is simply the best . i also suggest reading maxine brown 's book " looking back to see , a country music memoir . " it 's a well written ( and interesting ) cover of the the history of the browns
161,i hate this book . it is extremely boring and it is way too long . there are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar . do not read this unless forced to . i like to read , but this nearly put me to sleep . avoid at all cost
162,i really enjoyed this dvd-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns . the instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image . i teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves . and , you will work up a sweat , if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march . enjoy
163,there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments . i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments . i am glad i did . the light from the mirror is bright , the slide bar for the different light settings works very well . if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time . i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use . the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out .
164,all i can say is you must try this !
165,i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos . we promptly sent it back for a refund . i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !
166,not to be disrespectful but are you people for real ? i ca n't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars . there was nothing good about this book . a bunch of people in the book did not even matter , bill kendall 's wife , the new anchor man pete whatever his last name was , the boss yelena , eliza 's boyfriend , the priest , even the soon-to-be-president and his wife , i mean what 's the point in even mentioning them ? they were not involved in the main events . she did n't even talk about what happened to them at the end . the judge is the only one that matters , and she did n't even write about him all that much . really disappointing . as i said i do n't mean to be disrespectful , but to give this book 5stars , you must have read either bedtime stories all your life , or not have read anything . don " t waste your money that 's all i have to say . sorr
167,the title of this book should be " photoshop finishing borders " dave devotes too much time and effort giving tips on framing and giving borders to your images . there are a few other tips i was happy to see , however i have to give this one a definite thumbs down . i still love you dave . ( i want my money back !
168,darren aronofsky 's movies are beautiful masterpieces . from " pi " to " the fountain " , going through " requiem for a dream " , they will forever stand as timeless jewels . so they are hard to top in any way , but clint mansell has been able to do it every single time , scoring each of them . for " the fountain " , he teamed up once more with kronos quartet and had scottish post-rock band mogwai join in too , to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove , in a very organic way . the central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses . the combination of the talents of mansell , the quartet and mogwai yields a relatively dark , yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score
169,i am a calligrapher and i am always looking for poems and prayers to write and have framed and then present to the newlyweds . i was excited when i opened the book and read some of the beautiful verses . i tell you i am in a calligrapher 's heaven . my brother is a minister and as the " wedding season " is approaching i will be ordering a copy for him . if i could rate this book higher than the 5 stars i would . thank you , thank you , thank you ! ! ! ! ! ! !
170,i heard so much about masaki kobayashi 's " harakiri " , so i bought it at amazon and watched it . wow , this movie is awesome ! ! now i do n't know who is my #1 favorite director , akira kurosawa or masaki kobayashi . this black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by tohru takemitsu . in addition to these assets , the camera is wonderful . i pick this movie as one of " my movies of my life " . tatuyua nakadai was shining in this movie . i like him more after seeing " harakiri " .
171,the author is a journalist , but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right-wing think tank . like business elites , the author basically does not particularly like democracy . in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed . he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism , based on laws , rights , especially property rights , separation of powers , with much of that power being held in unelected bodies , and most of all free-market capitalism . he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy . his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits . most in the west do care . rights and legal systems are not neutral : the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment . though the author 's real target is us society , he looks at the results of democracy over the world . and of course , he finds plenty of examples where democracy does n't work . a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms . but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us . in the us , the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years . in actuality , he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism . in this era , elites in finance , business , law , banking , health care , various media , etc have likewise been swept up , in fact are the driving force , in a money-first culture . he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses . it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment . the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal-mart juggernaut . he especially decries direct citizen actions . he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences , often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets . however , he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes . it 's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century , and their heirs , should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course , after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums . if citizens had actually been democratically empowered , such distortions of the political process could have been prevented . the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie . his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable . who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies : the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites ? no , rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy , not buttressed it . if the author put journalism first , instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism , he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process , actually foiling democracy . first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system , distorting and muting all challenging ideas . it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire , free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements , worker visa programs , massive immigration , out-of-control energy policies , broken health care systems , huge cutbacks in various safety net programs , massive redistribution of wealth upwards , the gutting of our manufacturing base , etc. the list could go on . informed , empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist . the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy , but is in the throes of democratic failure , which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically . this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore . it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book . americans are supposedly fiercely democratic . yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule , even anti-democratic generals if need be . the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment .
172,compared to the first humidifier i got from walmart , this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect . oh , well i just got it yesterday so it 's too early to say perfect , but considering others ' reviews , i am pretty confident that i am gonna love it longer than at the first sight . the only thing is i do n't know where to put it . the power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long . i am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest , or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time
173,from a pure image quality standpoint , this lens will not please the pixel peepers . on the wide end of the zoom , which i personally use more often than the telephoto end , this lens is not very sharp , and it suffers from fairly bad distortion . worse than that , for me , are the chromatic abberations ; this lens is quite prone to significant ca when shot at the wide end , which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness . given the price of this lens , one should expect a higher level of optical performance . the maximum aperture of this lens is not very large , being f / 4 on the wide end , and f / 5.6 on the telephoto end . the image stabilization makes up for this some , as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let 's be honest here ; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod . the small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder , which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark ( using a tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , and this is not without reason . first of all , the focal length range is quite handy . it is n't a mega-zoom that does everything , however , it covers the most often used focal length ranges , and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations . the little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion , and it 's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end , but zoomed in , it 's quite good . i have printed as large as 20x30 " using this lens on a digital rebel , and have no qualms with the results . yes , there are sharper lenses out there , but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print . this lens has ring usm , which enables it to focus very quietly , and very quickly , whereas the slightly cheaper ( and f2.8 ) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison . if you want to use this lens indoors , you are best off getting a flash to go with it , such as a 430ex . the lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting , or during the day , but wo n't give you good results in low light with no flash . if you will be shooting in lower light situations ( people in particular ) , tamron and sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with f2.8 apertures , and i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you 'd prefer the extra telephoto range , the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field ( instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f / 4 , for instance , without image stabilization , you could use f / 11 on this lens , and get a sharp picture with better depth of field . this is even more useful in the close focus range - while this is n't a true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without a tripod , you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field , and the is helps with that quite a bit . overall , i 've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens . if you like to worry about splitting hairs , and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer , this lens is likely to dissapoint you . if , however , you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded , useful lens , then i 'd recommend it , however , would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options , as they are also great lenses , and do offer a somewhat better value
174,this camera works well , except that the shutter speed is a bit slow . the image quality is decent . the use of aa rechargeable batteries is also convenient . the camera is pretty sturdy . i 've dropped it a few times and it still works fine
175,i ca n't believe the touch of b.b. king . i enjoy his playing immensely . i know this album gets buried in accolades . but i do n't like it . the quality is poor and , differing from other 's opinions , the crowd noise takes away from the music . b.b. said , in so many words , that live at the regal was far from his choice as his best recording . typically , he said he would n't argue with success- -and left it at that . there are so many good albums by b.b. you ca n't go wrong for $4.65 for the " ultimate collection " . sure it does n't have them all- -but it has quite a few of his great songs , including a few from live at the regal . i would steer clear of this selection . or i 'll send you mine for free
176,as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter . as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes / deficiencies in the book , and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about . for instance , the claim on page 86 that ( #cdata ) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong . his description of schema element declarations ( pp . 114-115 ) teaches that using globals / refs is the only way to define complex elements , and is inappropriate for his example . he makes no mention of globals at all , leaving the reader confused . i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information
177,if you liked " raise the red lantern " or " the last emperor " , this is a perfect movie.gong li , who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband 's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband . " farewell my concubine " uses chinese opera as a way of telling the story.i used to listen to a lot of chinese opera- -which is an acquired taste.this movie uses the story of a king&his beloved concubine 's self-sacrifice to frame the love story between two men.when one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman , the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.the final scenes are chilling , powerful.this is a spectacle not to be missed
178,the camera is a great camera.it is one of the best kind of camera in its level.everything is great in that ( perfect picture and easy to work ) but in that package as i saw in amazon add , the remote suppose to be in the package and comes with it but it wo n't and there is not remute in that package and it is kind of cheating...be careful about this product if you think whatever has written comes with package but not .
179,do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras ( ie the 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception . i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this is your first l lens , you 'll be hooked . this is a lens you will have for many years , great investment
180,i see where this would be appealing to sum . i just never " got it " . oh well .
181,i first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring gary cole as dr. jeffrey macdonald . the miniseries absolutely riveted me , as did this book . but upon repeated readings , i began to pick up inaccuracies and errors . i found that the book , rather than answering questions about this case , caused me to question more and more . joe mcginniss , while never a stellar writer to begin with , was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer , twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose , which was to sell his theory and therefore , his book . i have nothing against mr. mcginniss forming his own opinion as to dr. macdonald 's guilt or innocence , but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening . if you want joe mcginniss ' theory on how and why the murders happened , with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence , pick this book up . if you want to read about the case , with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning dr. macdonald , do as other reviewers have suggested and read " fatal justice " , a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion .
182,we purchased this software to map retail locations on a region . it is missing too many features to be usable . for instance , when you import a custom graphic pushpin , the software does n't resize it as you zoom which forces you to create multiple sizes in another program . you can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing - - and they do n't resize either . we highlighted our specific region but the software does n't let you print just that region ( called ' territory . ) we searched the help files and their word ' territory ' is not even listed . you cannot save your map graphics in any standard graphics format , e.g. jpeg , pdf or ai . we tried printing to a pdf generator , but map point 's map output is of very poor resolution even on the highest settings . after wasting a lot of time , it 's apparent we should have tried google maps / earth with our graphics editing software for a solution that works
183,it is fiction of course . it can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is impossible ! many reviewers are upset . upset perhaps but they should not be worried . the church is protected by christ 's promise that it will not err . any person of faith sees this book as fiction . it is a poor attempt to disguise greely 's left wing theology as fiction . the message to those liberals who find & quot ; hope&quot ; for their cause in this book : it ai n't going to happen . recommended reading : & quot ; women priests and other fantasies&quot ; greely and his followers are delusional
184,i ordered this scale for a blind senior citizen . the english speaking voice has a british accent and is difficult to understand . the scale wobbles when you stand on it making you feel unstable , especially for someone with impaired eyesight
185,this product is nothing like the desktop version of the software . so limited in functions , you might as well have a paper map .
186,i will keep this review simple . for the price this is an ok deal . however : the bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop . the battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality batteries are generic rechargeables . you are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger / batteries . it will wind up costing you less in the long run
187,our family has enjoyed this a lot , since we take a lot of trips in our rv . great way to entertain on the road . we really liked the questions about pop music and movies , also some great questions about the us presidents . very entertaining , clever
188,over all i am very happy with the product . it has paid for itself in this short time by just making happy birthday cards . i am not totally happy with the product and i am not sure if i would buy it again . the product is well worth the money you are paying but their is a few things which i am not happy about : 1. even though the product gives you cd 's which contain art and project models their is more art and projects on the internet . to access these art and projects you need to go on the internet which is not a problem . what is a problem is that if you want to get on this site and a lot of other people are on the site already you may not be able to get on the site . if you cannot get on the site you cannot finish your project . you will have to put it away until some other time when you can get on the site . this is frustrating and annoying . it makes you want to take the entire program and through it out the window and buy another brand . 2. the other thing i was not happy about was , i was given a coupon , in the box , for a 1 year membership to the " million image club " to get into this club you have to fill out some paperwork and submit it on the internet . after it is reviewed you are then sent a pass word , over the internet , that allows you to go on the site . well , i filled out all the paperwork , sent it in over the internet , as required , but was not sent a password . well , i tried to find some one to talk to about this but ran into a brick wall after spending a lot of time being directed from one site to another only to end up with no answer to the problem . it seems that broderbund does not control the product but " encore " does . you will receive almost no help at all from " encore " . the only place to get help is from a forum which could n't give a reasonable answer on what i should do . so , i am now not getting access to the " million image club " , to tell you the truth , i do n't really care . when you finally can get on the site you have hundreds of images and models to choose from . you really do n't need a million more .
189,the previous review is clear about the value of this translation . knowing a bit of german , i can say that this translation does use shapes instead of forms for gestalten . the real value of the work beyond the translation , however , especially for first time readers , is found in the notes made by david luke . these notes are helpful for the historical context , allusions to goethe 's personal life and work , and allusions to philosophy , literature , and more ... all essential to understanding the work
190,a pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family , ` you can count on me ' tells the story of sammy ( laura linney ) and terry prescott ( mark ruffalo ) , siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young . years later and sammy is a single mother of 8-year-old rudy ( rory culkin ) , she works hard at her job at the bank , now run by over critical brain everett ( matthew broderick ) , and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is ( josh lucas has a great cameo as rudy senior ) . when terry shows up after months of no communication sammy is immediately thrilled , but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw-up and is just using her , again . terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend 's abortion , but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with sammy and rudy . over the course of a few weeks terry has made a deep impact , especially in the life of young rudy who idolizes him . this film follows the changes each of these siblings make , changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make . it 's a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it should n't be missed . the performances by the two leads are outstanding , and young rory culkin is adorable and mature as sammy 's son , but the real shock to me was matthew broderick who played the demanding , philandering , unlikable type brilliantly , and he 's not one i 'm generally impressed with
191,this program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful . installation is self explanatory . this also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics . if you are looking for an easy to use program with great results , this is the one to get . with the cost of cards being what it is , this program will pay for itself very quickly . relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized . i recommend this program highly
192,dsc series camera all have a ccd imager defect that will leave screen blank after you use the camera for 2 or 3 years . ( do a google search . you will find out what happened . ) sony knew this problem years ago . but refuse to fix it . they will wait until the camera fail and then charge you $300 to fix it . that 's what happens to my dsc-f717. ever wondering why dell , hp etc all recall sony battery for laptop , but sony did not recall their own laptop battery ? sony will never fix their own problem . we the customer have to pay for their mistake .
193,blind items has the same writing style as at least one of rettenmund 's other books ( boy culture ) . he goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs . kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the sunday magazine section of your newspaper . if you like this writing style , rettenmund 's books may be for you . personally it drove me crazy and i set the book down after the first few chapters
194,great casting , but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film . it 's so aggravating . i want to chew my own leg off half way into it . i know part of it is everyone is a " talker " of a various sort . they 're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell . i just do n't think it works . otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived . the best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves . it gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name . mamet 's an extraordinary genius-writer , but this did not belong on the screen .
195,this is a great movie , especially if you like & quot ; dancehall queen&quot ; . paul campbell does a great job as capone and carl bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss . while the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching
196,hell rell did his job , i was n't expecting anything as good as this . hell rell outdid himself .
197,as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction , however midway it turns into a romance novel . i give it 3 stars for holding my attention . a good beach read that can get you thinking ( a little ) about a time past . the one star is a mistake and i cannot seem to change it . 3 *** stars
198,i purchased this item two weeks ago . my thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced , perfect addition to the " tools " necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby ( its advertised contents , construction , and " glow-in-the-dark " planisphere ) . after closely examining the item for the past ten days , i 'm forced to conclude that i was in error , and that you really do get what you pay for . as celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy , i must confess that i assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name . i have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps . the major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings , letter transpositions , apparent omitted words , and just plain ( what we used to call in the old days ) " typographical errors . " additionally , when i compare some of the technical information on the maps ( i.e. , star magnitudes , astronomical distances , etc. ) and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources i have in my possession , i also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances . when using a product like this , it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains . since i 'm not able to do this , i must rate this item with one star . when i purchased the item , it was marked down by twenty percent . i note that in less that two weeks since my purchase , the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent . in this case , do n't be fooled ( as i was ) by an attractive price . avoid this product . ( i do n't have a substitute to recommend at this time . )
199,i want the two hours of my life back ! after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in 1973. that time is past ( even then , the " robots attack people " concept was hardly new ) . now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action . this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes . unless you are doing a research paper on american sci-fi cinema , or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid , or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies , avoid this dull piece of drivel . i feel cheated !
200,a broad range of jewish-related-topic movies varies from " trembling before the g...d " to " the holy land " , where jewish humor , emphasis on the holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of . of course , modern israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day-by-day israeli reality , incorporating h o h m e s ( sarcastic jokes ) if necessary . something more linking to a secular modern american reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex-bent traditionally-characteristic inter-religious-confession-gesheft ( profit ) pieces of gay-lesbian-adultery-quickie-drug-secular-hasidic traces of affairs , which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly . sorry , it is definitely not my cap of tea . if even this play is r-rated .
201,this pad barely got warm . it 's going back ! since this is the same complaint as with another sunbeam model i tried , i suspect it is n't defective but intentional.. . probably for legal reasons . but should n't a heating pad actually have some heat to it ? ?
202,this is a truly amazing deal from amazon , where i also received free priority mail shipping . the photo does not display all that you will get . you will receive 6 boxes of q-tips cotton swabs , totaling an ammazing 3 , 500 q-tips in all . i will never ever have to purchase another q-tip as long as i live ! ! ! ! ! what a fantastic deal from amazon !
203,for a true christian spirit that glows through ms. winans , you 'll always find her music sung straight from the heart . a precious pearl in the gospel community , " purified " continues in the cece tradition , of lifting our souls to a higher plain
204,oh dear . this is another book like the horrible " who moved my cheese ? " that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children . like the aforementioned " who thinks my cheese stinks ? " ( or whatever it is called ) , i saw some people in the organisation where i work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days . it 's all about making work " fun " . yep , work can be " fun " . tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal . or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases . of course , it 's just great " fun " to deal with children who have just had their parents killed , or folks who just lost their kids . because that 's what work is - " fun " - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers . of course in the examples i have listed above , it does n't really work too well , because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be " fun " . myself , i do have some " fun " at work , but probably like many people with more than one brain cell , it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us . you can call this cynicism , which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb " fish " -style " work must be fun " philosophy . i 'd call it black humour , but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable . as to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace " fun " in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise . first immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as " fun " . second , let them know that they now " choose " their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way ( regardless of them doing their work well or not ) , they are " letting the team down " and not complying with the obligation to " make work fun " . third , while the majority of victims or workers , however you choose to view your prey , swallow the " work is fun " message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of fish , you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not having fun at work and use the enron-style message that they " just do n't get it " . in this way , the resistant individual can be said to be " incompatible with our mission and values " , " bad for morale " or just " out of step " . in this way , the " fun-loving " workers , who have now taken on the costume of " forced false fun " can be set against them . of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign . this book is useful then , if you wish to convince idiots that their " work is fun " . just do n't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously . they might tell you to stick your " fish " where the sun does n't shine
205,after starting my 9 / 11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown " what ! " after " loose change - 2nd ed " last year , i 've watched and or read just about them all . 9 / 11 : press for truth comes out on top , in my humble opinion , as the best 9 / 11 timeline presentation out there . nothing included that is n't in the mainstream press - just on the back page , and spread out over five years . the film makes few of the outright accusations that " loose change 2nd - ed " does towards any of the events or people involved in 9 / 11 , but delivers more of damning argument that we 've been lied to - there were n't just mistakes made , but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government . i hope that we , the people , finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out . and the bad guys pay . good movie
206,a wonderful book providing a myriad of ideas for those of us who need not only a basic review of knitting but an introduction to a new world of knitting . thank you chapman tracy for such beautiful photos , tips , etc. i 've already given this book as a gift and will continue to highly recommend it
207,had long looked forward to finally reading this " acclaimed " novel . there are brilliant and imaginative highlights in the book , although finding those bits is like looking for light in a black hole , a lot of work for very little result . i truly believe this is a book that would be more interesting if one increased their medication level way past the recommended daily dosage . mark
208,halfway through it and it is very good concerning the difficulties that physicians who are married or in a serious relationships face thoughout their careers . a good read for those entering the profession and a must read for those recently married
209,i was deeply disappointed by the so-called & quot ; return of the funk&quot ; with the headhunters reuniting with their original lineup . as compared to herbie hancock 's original & quot ; headhunters&quot ; release , the return of the headhunters is missing one main ingredient , the grease . this recent release has traded the & quot ; grits and gravy&quot ; created by the sounds of overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers , for over-produced smooth jazz-funk , complete with overused n'dea davenport r&amp ; b hooks that left this album flat
210,if a book makes me look forward to mid-life - i am all over it ! this book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find ! here , harvard researcher and bestselling author , joan borysenko , takes the cycles of a woman 's life and divides them into 7 year increments . along the journey , she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging . ? that 's a big 10-4 , ms. borysenko ! i find myself constantly at odds with the " beauty " images that the media gives us . i mean , come on , why ' o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society ? perhaps it 's escapism - i tell myself ( in effort to sleep at night ) . yet , after reading borsyenko 's , book i 'm reminded that , yes , it 's good to follow intellectual pursuits . and , yes , there 's differences between women and men . according to borysenko , women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society , family , and how to make a difference in the world . men tend to define themselves by their work . most telling ! anyhow , i wo n't give away the store here - but in my opinion , if you are of the female persuasion , you will not want to miss this read .
211,i have used three of these . the first two each lasted a year before shorting out . i kept buying them because i liked the cordkeeper function . this last one , though , shorted out and started a fire . i have notified the company and will see what happens . but i doubt that i will purchase another . it 's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market .
212,i got really disapointed when i received and read this book . it provides advanced techniques that a regular woodworker would never use . the parts that woodworkers use the most are vague . i 'm not intereset in making violins or boats . i need techniques to bend wood , to use joints for curved surfaces , to build equipment and fixtures to bend wood and so on . this book lacks of the practical guidelines to do so
213,the disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style . it makes my arm and finger tired
214,i purchased a canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and uv filtering lense . the case came within a few days and is perfect for what i needed . smooth fast transaction . five star
215,i was misled and thought i was buying the entire cd and it contains one song
216,simply the most entertaining mockumentary / film i 've seen in years and one of the best ever . the dvd is packed full of extras and outtakes so the fun lasts much longer than you 'd expect . jenna fischer is brilliant and james gunn is hilarious . you just have to buy it to understand
217,i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case . if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product . great quality nevertheless
218,i 've been using this for the last 3 months and i 'm a very satisfied customer . i get a very close shave , and no razor bumpors . i 'm afircan american and my beard is coarse and curly , sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown hair problems . i highly recommend this , because it 's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as braun and norelic . it 's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil . i cam across these because the only time i would get a great shave was at the barber . when he used clippers on me i 've never had any problems with ingrown hair , therefore i decided to own my own pair of clippers . i 'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming
219,the songs are boring , the lyrics are plain . i am so dissapointed . i bought it without listening to it first thinking i would at least find one song . how wrong was i to find out that not even one track speaks to me . andrea 's solo album sucked . now this ! i think their creative days are over and if i see them in concert again , i hope i am not tortured with the music from this new album . instead i hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band i love so muc
220,excellent product one any computer owner must own and install for efficient and safe daily opperation online.quick delivery with ideal ups tracking ensureing accuate deivery and not to mention the best price online , bravo zulu ! good show amazon
221,mutual fund basis calculations are broken , updates fail on the mac . not to mention no state in this edition . it 's absurd how many different versions of turbotax there are this year . it almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes . i 'm done with turbotax , switching to taxcu
222,unlike many reviewers i am not diver . i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park , pool , and beach . this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash . this case has out lived an s400 and s500. well worth the $170 price tag
223,i still have not received this dvd . it was ordered on 12 / 8 / 06 and was supposed to ship on 12 / 12 / 06. i am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a christmas gift . i cannot rate the product as i do n't have it . i sent an e-mail through amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them . i would appreciate a response or a refund
224,order received in good time - no problems . battery lifetimes are short - not as good as first original from dealer , but twice as good as poorer choice batteries from other suppliers
225,this is a great collection of hits from the 70's . it is packed with hits . it is a great addition to a 70 's hits collection
226,consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan , calvino 's fiction is sui generis , a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory-oriented " if on a winter 's night a traveler . " this is the kind of novel borges might have written . a celebration of the unbridled imagination , " invisible cities " is also , i am convinced , a secret love letter to a single city : the imaginary dream-city of venice , a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea
227,the quality of this cd recording sounds like someone tapped it in their garage and burned it to cd with thier personal pc . very bad recording . it 's too bad because lathleen madigan is very witty and funny .
228,i love heinlein . i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction . i find that his plots and ideas are inventive . even this story was inventive in many ways , like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters . however , i found this book as a whole to be very boring . much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters . the & quot ; main&quot ; characters of each section of the book are n't fully realized at all . i would n't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really , really bored
229,less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor , " in like flint " still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the bond films . the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world , this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world 's women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes ( leading to , perhaps , the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film- -upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be , a disbelieving flint says , " an actor as president ? " ) . that is , until a renegade zowie general ( steve inhat ) decides it 's his turn to take the reins of power . the delightful lee j . cobb is back as flint 's curmudgeonly boss , cramden , as are the secret agent 's posse of female admirers , and tv 's batgirl , yvonne craig , even shows up as a russian ballerina . " in like flint " feels more grown up than the previous film , partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody . notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind- -and charging a premium for them- -are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows , cross-dressing , and the bouncing sing-a-long ball . only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth comment , as it 's a staple of the genre , meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort : a no-frills dvd .
230,over the years i have been using quantum turbo and later 2x2 units ( no turbo sc yet ) to power various canon speed-lights from 540ez to ex580. with some skepticism i picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment . well , although quantum units still have a place in my kit to power metz unit , i love the convenience of cp-e3. one recommendation . buy couple of extra battery inserts , if you do lot of fast shootings , and keep them loaded with good quality duracell nimh 's
231,when my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him . it was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings . then i bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out . just enough to see your baby by , but not enough to keep everyone awake . it 's been almost a year now , and i 'm just about to purchase two more . we use the light now in our toddler 's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine . we use it every night
232,the product works pretty much as advertised and i received it in a fairly timely manner
233,carlton mellick the 3rd 's " punk land " ( a pseudo-sequel to his 2001 novel " satan burger " ) wastes no time in getting straight to the story . it is set in an alternate heaven for punks , where sid vicious is god and you are judged for entry not by st. peter but rather a number of gate attendants who decide whether or not you are punk enough . mellick 's trademark off-beat humor and sideways take on religion is ever-present , along with a slew of philosophical ideas mixed with a juvenile sense of mischief . although it is a sequel , it stands completely on it 's own . fans of satan burger will appreciate the references and the continued story of nan and mortician , but new readers are n't left wondering about a back story . and anyone with even a slight interest in punk rock or punk culture will be in well , punk heaven , with all the references to punk history and culture and appearances by icons including g.g. allin , henry rollins , and johnny rotten . the book is also full of illustrations , diagrams , photos and lists , which help to give it a wonderful multimedia type feel . you 'll find yourself torn between finishing the paragraph you 're in and jumping directly over to the flier for the " pbr pogo joust " advertised on the next page . this is a great book , a sublimely goofy sort of work that is effortlessly good but never takes itself too seriously . highly recommended for anyone who likes mellick 's work , but even more so for anyone who has never read any of his books . this is a great place to discover the works of a young , groundbreaking author who is only getting better with time
234,i never thought that i could get my hair straight enough to actually like it . until i found this vs sassoon straightener . it is the best ! ! i use it all the time and i love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather soft . i would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super straight , soft hair , to use this product . you ca n't go wrong !
235,jesse , 15 lives in harlem , new york city . he is the only child of a bright couple and his best friend , rise is one of his biggest influences . jesse and rise grew up together . when rise , 17 turns to crime and joins the counts , a local street gang and insists on bringing jesse in with him along with their friend c.j. , jesse starts to reassess their friendship . he sadly realizes that he and rise are traveling down different streets ; the drive-by shooting of their friend bobby , 14 has left the neighborhood shaken . c.j. , a musical prodigy who plays piano in their church also has his sights set on a different path . it is c.j. and jesse , a budding young artist who is quite talented at drawing who realize they have more in common with each other . rise and the counts are in for a count-down ; sadly , drive-bys claim more casualties . the counts were described as being on the tame end of street gangs ; a warring faction called the diablos were responsible for shooting a friend ; killing a cabbie and later , some members of the counts . sidney , a kind and fair police officer takes the boys under his wing . he is respected in the neighborhood and word on the street was that he was a fair man , which he was . when mason , 19 an older member of the counts was busted for homicide , it was sidney who took rise and jesse to the jail ( " iron city " ) to see the fate in store for their former friend . more problems crop up in the neighborhood ; rise , seeing a chance to leave harlem wants to call jesse and the counts together for a final goodbye . sadly , that goodbye really was the end . this is an excellent book that reflects the city and street culture well . the characters are fresh , cutting edge , serious and believable . the drawings were excellent and a bonus to this book . jesse , an aspiring cartoonist created two west indian charcters , a wise man and a bird . the bird was a metaphor for jesse and it is through this avian character that he asks questions in his drawings that wise answers . myers has written many excellent books , but i think he really outdid himself with this one
236,this tripod arrived on time and in good condition . however i have to put the " heavy duty " in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well . the weight you can put on it is limited . however it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer
237,i was looking for an intructional cd to help my daughter to learn chess . i read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what i was looking for . wrong ! first of all , the cd comes with no instruction book and you 're left to try and figure out what you 're supposed to do by yourself ( good luck ) . i 've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and i still have n't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess . i 've emailed their ' help line ' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them . save your money and your sanity and do n't buy this cd .
238,i just bought this cd because i am learning haitian creole , and that 's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd . when i installed it , i was unable to find anything on the cd in haitian creole , even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case . so it has been a complete waste of money for me , perhaps if i was interested in the other languages i could give it more stars . it also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language , but that is not possible either , u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source . i am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product . if anyone can find creole on this cd i would be happy to stand corrected . ps i contacted imsi and they say the cd 's were mislabelled , there is no haitian creole on the cd , despite the fact that it is listed on the cover
239,i had jvc product and some of my friends too . these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem . even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly . price may be less buy its not worth for long run . i feel sony and canon are better than jvc . even hitachi is good
240,i rate this 5 stars based on my knowledge of the fantastic four and x-men complete editions . i 'm writing this review to warn people about my receiving 2 defective copies of the spider-man version from amazon . i 'll have to try a 3rd time
241,when it comes to big star 's 70 's output , you can call me a hopeless fanboy , because after listening to in space , it seems that only a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later , exactly one-half of the classic big star lineup could- --or in forever difficult alex chilton 's case , would be so inclined- --to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great . this disc has way more in common with chilton 's oft-times difficult , mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of big star 's previous fascinating pop near-perfection . while i 'll admit that i have enjoyed a good chunk of chilton 's solo work , ( in a slightly guilty , rolling-my-eyes , " oh...that alex ! " sorta way.. . ) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that this group and that this particular collection of songs are presented as " big star . " in space is connected musically to the original big star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in this band were in that band . if you do n't expect much , you wo n't be disappointed .
242,i am on my third off-camera cord ( about one per year ) . two have broken . as other reviewers noted , the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the " female " end of the cord loosen and eventually fail . i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black " spring " cover over the screws on the shoe . you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver . if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen . canon should do this at the factory . i use this cord with a stroboframe " portrait / landscape " grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light . the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord . when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted . i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable . unfortunately , i do not believe that there are alternative cords . it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords
243,as a casual piano player and a broadway fanatic , i was so jazzed to play some of the songs from avenue q . the book contains everything you find on the cd and includes a few production photos . of course the little details are fun , using terms like " manilowesque " " huey-lewis shuffle " " prissy sonata " and " funky a** groove " to describe some of the songs . fun fun fu
244,the 1 star is for this 5 star cd box set being no longer available . does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon ? i have the highlights cd and the " live at the plugged nickel " double lp - but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling . thank you in advance for any help . scott k fis
245,i put off buying this for many years . having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous , i did n't want to taint my perceptions of the queen legacy . so i ignored this album . then , one day , i was listening to innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again . i came here and read many positive reviews , so i took the plunge . i came out the other side very content . the legacy had not been tainted . the album is uneven in places , but the songs that are good are very good ( mother love , let me live ) . with some albums like this , it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in . now , i do n't know exactly how this was done , but the songs feel seamless , even the dance track " you do n't fool me , " which i can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club . of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out ( especially in " mother love " ) , but upon the conclusion of the album , i want to say to the brian and the boys ( men ) , " you 've done good .
246,this software suite promises to do everything on earth , but does n't tell us how . there is no useful help file . there are no tutorials or instructions on the website . and , nero 's support is a joke ( just try to get a message through ) . i do n't understand how a company that started out with the best burn program in the game has sunk to this
247,this camera does everything it says ; yes , it 's waterproof and i was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time ! ! only reason i did n't give it 5 stars : it is as slow as every other digital camera i 've owned as far as focusing , multiple flashes , and then actually shooting . you get your subject 's attention and they smile , frozen , as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken ( in low light . ) i was especially intrigued by its " bright capture " technology , but it honestly does n't seem any different in low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera . still that same flash-in-the-dark look . there is a fill-flash low light program mode ( among many many others ) , but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob , even if you hold your breath and try to remain still . my ideal snapshot camera is portable , durable , quick , easy , and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes . this camera has 3.5 out of those 5. it is way portable , very durable , easy , produces ok results but you have to mess with settings if you 're not in daylight , and it 's not very quick . overall i am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere
248,i have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it . it is easy to use and clean i have only had to charge it once so far . even though this is my first electric shaver , it is a good deal for the money . it does n't shave as close as a razor but it 's close . i would recommend it or give it as a gift .
249,i have not heard of or listened to , this cd series , but from the sound of it , its all bad interpretations of popular music . i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff.. . play classical music . play stuff without lyrics . play a show on tv where the characters sing . do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place . censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song . there are just some songs that are n't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words . think about this.. . do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ? listen.. . i 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not the way to go . all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gonna be asking questions . do them and yourself a favor and do n't buy these cds
250,after brushing with the hydrabrush , my teeth feel as clean as when i 've been to the dental hygenist . this is a great product . i am so glad that replacement brushes are available at amazon
251,between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood . much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program . my ear is now tuned to the language . i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses . my vocabulary still needs to get stronger , but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french , that is only a matter of practice with the language . as advertised , this program is painless and progress is rapid . try the demo , you 'll see .
252,this is nothing compared to their ep , which was great by the way . songs lack of inventive , arrangements and feeling.. . maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued , but no more
253,my first aquis mitt was rectangular . i like this one better . rounding the edges makes sense since it is meant to be worn on the hand . aquis microfiber is the only fabric i use on my face . it is gentle on the skin , yet cleans more thoroughly than anything else i have used . ( i find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric ! ) if the manufacturer is listening , i would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2. this would be perfect for bathing baby / children . there is a slit in the seam , on the thumb side , so your thumb can protrude . you can grip / lift without removing your mitts . some size choices ( s / m & l / xl ) would be nice , as this mitt would not fit a large man 's han
254,what an outrageous group , how can anyone like this rubbish . maybe an horde of brainless people . how i feel happy in being intelligent , and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres . how said romans , " it 's just bread and circus to the poors " . give to people what they deserve , rubbish ! it 's because you mediocre people that buy this , that this kind of people , the members of this group , get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be . it 's the same horde that buy , beyonce , spears , madona , and other outrageous poor music .
255,a wonderful wonderful book.although the book was written some 150 year ago , mary eliza rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in palestine in the 1850 's as if it was occurring today . she writes from her heart with honesty , integrity and a clear mind . and although written at a time of victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement . from her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the holy land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change . for anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book
256,this item was offered as a suggested accessory to the nikon monarch atb 8x42 waterproof binoculars that i purchased . i later also purchased the 12x42 binoculars . this harness can not be attached to either pair of binoculars ! the hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars . other than that the harness is a well made quality product
257,this book covers the entire state in one easy-to-carry book . whether you 're looking for romantic bed and breakfasts in the wine country , the hippest restaurant in san francisco , or the best beaches in la and san diego , this book is all you 'll need . it covers hotels ranging from a beach front motel in santa monica to the best places to stay in yosemite 's camp grounds
258,this the best product out there for preventing and ridding red bumps , ingrown hairs , and the other unslightly skin / hair irritations
259,thank you for showing me , i will use it as many times when it comes into my mailbox soon
260,as has been noted , this formula has been filmed several times , most recently as " you 've got mail " , with tom hanks and meg " trout pout " ryan . of the several versions , " in the good old summertime " is my least favorite . the problem i think is that the studio coasted on the stars charisma , which does n't quite cut it here . the chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie . there are no real sparks . van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old donuts , pleasant but stale . and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow . judy in particular is disappointing . she looks like she has no neck ! i do n't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it 's head into it 's shell , all hunched up and everything . i could n't figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about . i would have made a bee line for that cute violin player . and van was n't great either . i 've always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he does n't do anything to dispel that image here . if you 're a fan of the stars or the early 1900 's then you might like this movie . but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there , and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection
261,as a boy , i was fascinated by looking at all of the drawings and descriptions in this diary . it gave me a great appreciation for life in the us in the early 1800s , and the fortitude and ingenuity of our forefathers . i have found that the magic still holds , as i read it to each of my sons when they were about 8. they still love the basic how-to descriptions which bring frontier construction to life
262,while i absolutely love the show on pbs , this season was mispackaged . the box and dvd were both labeled series 3 , but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1 / 2. unfortunately , i did n't try watching this disc until several months after i bought it . if you buy this , be sure you view it promptly to be certain it 's the correct series
263,crikey ! ! ! ! what is this chunder ? wait a minute....art students from " down under " get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of " the wiggles " , decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base ! yeah , this stuff could be the soundtrack to " forrest gump " alright . " run , forrest , run ! run as fast as you can from this crap ! ! ! " and these guys are touring , too ? are they touring with barney & friends ? there is not one thing of value to this other than that the cd itself makes a handy coaster for your foster's ..
264,this album is okay not their best . a few songs are good other than that this album is fair.purcahse it with your money intelligently ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
265,i had the distinct pleasure of seeing richard jeni live a few years ago and i gotta tell you that i really almost peed my pants . he was astoundingly funny . this dvd definitely captures his comic genius , although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed . it was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which , from what i heard , was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get , which is itself really sad . he developed what i think is the best comedy , which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are , ultimately , pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world . he will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so , how we should and can be a lot better than we are
266,please change your name to ( kid rap ) .. when you start producing true rock cd 's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name.. . stop playing both sides. . i realize that the rap - hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls / boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about. . do yourself a favor and take the rap / hip hop out of your so called music . one day you will realize that the rap / hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away. .
267,grudem seems to have a very distorted and confused vision of christ . we can only hope that evangelical become more like christ . jesus was the first real liberal and the most radical of liberals . if jesus of nazareth was anything , he was an extraordinary friend of the down - trodden , definitely a liberal , whose advocacy on their behalf so infuriated the ultra-conservative religious and political leaders of his day that they had him killed to prevent the public from hearing the very liberal teaching that you will see quoted abundantly in jesus ' own words on this web site ! those who actually know what the bible says about the life and teaching of jesus recognize that far from being like jesus of nazareth , today 's " religious right " are much more like the kind of clerics who battled this revolutionary prophet from the day he opened his mouth until the day they had him nailed to a cross . although these people claim to represent jesus christ , they rarely quote his teaching or follow his example . what they do instead is use his name ( " in vain " ) to promote their ideas , ideas which jesus himself did not teach , and might well have opposed .
268,i gave this to a bearded man for christmas . to my knowledge , he has used it only once , with no complaints . was nice for the main reason , he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one . this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it . purchasing was a breeze . thank yo
269,of little or no use - much to difficult to use when you are excercising - i find this product totally unacceptabl
270,i 've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported paintshoppro and corel products . i have to say i am very disappointed in the new version , pspxi . no problems with the download , but the program crashes easily , you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9 , basically is slower in everything you do . i am a photographer , and looked forward to the new photo features , which work , but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it . just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between . i have searched the net and support wise , the upgrades and patches have not helped . corel is not solving the problem and maybe they can't . this is not a pc problem which they so want us to believe . i have plenty of memory and speed on my pc . it may be something involving how the xi stores it 's cache . not sure . but the changes are not workable , sadly . i think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with , or they will find themselves out of the ps market . this is not just me talking , it has happened to alot of loyal fans . because it could be the better than photoshop if they fix it . if you really want the program , download the free trial first and or try the x or 9 version , especially if your pc is an older model .
271,downloaded the new mcafee software . my computer is now slowed over 90% of the speed of a snail - both with aol and internet explorer . mcafee customer service is of no value whatever . mcafee faq describes a very dangerous fix which involves editing the registry file but even those instructions do n't seem to work as described . what a mistake
272,this was a great dvd i bought it for my husband and he loved it . there were a few episodes that we never saw and the outakes were really funny . i definately would recomend
273,i do n't really understand all the reviews about sun tzu 's work . people saying that this one or that one is closer to the original ; are there really that many experts in ancient chinese out there . how can anyone say which is the best translation unless they are personally familiar with the original , in the original chinese , and if that the case they should write their own version
274,i bought this book before my first trip to austria . i had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations . that turned out to be true . what shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that austrian women are strong-minded and independent and organize their homelife well , although many go to work ? this book might have some value for a person who had never left their english-speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna or at the beach . it also provides some amusing anecdotes about language ( especially viennese ) and useful info about festivals . mostly , though this book was good for reading aloud to austrian friends . i would quote it as an iron-clad authority when their behavior did n't quite match the book 's version and thereby amused them tremendously . - -lynn hoffman , author of the new short course in wine and the forthcoming novel bang bang from kunati books.isbn 978160164000
275,all " style " and no substance . even the dance number with john travolta & uma thurman was lackluster . and would cedric the " entertainer " please go away ? i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good . i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud . i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over .
276,i selected a sony vf-30cpkxs polarizing filter but it took me to this page where i got a sony vf-r30nkx 30mm neutral density filter . there is a big difference . may 9 , 2006. i hope this is a mistake and not intentional deception
277,this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer . there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property . even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino 's " kill bill " films , his salute to the genre , or " reservoir dogs , " which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence . " bullet ... " is little more than two hours of broken glass , fire , blood squirts , amputation , beatings and explosions . this makes gladiator look like a sunday school picnic . the characters are totally flat , one-dimensional . there is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc . the acting is weak , static , despite the fact that i do n't understand a word of cantonese . we are presented with a series of stereotypes ( the hooker with a heart of gold , the good friend , the crazy friend and the bad friend ) . unfortunately the american stereotype of the viet cong as madmen - - and saigon as hopelessly corrupt - - is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of viet nam during the american occupation . the worst thing is that - - because they are so shallow and undeveloped - - you do n't care what happens to the characters . so i 'll tell you and then you wo n't have to finish watching the film : they kill each other . my advice- - skip it
278,for the most part , these people whom the author thought are prominent jews are either ignoramuses as regards to judaism and our heritage ( especially the 2 supreme court justices , who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek ) or are not even jewish at all . a waste of time
279,i got this disc for one song , the uncut , full length version of " boogie wonderland " by earth , wind and fire ( with the emotions ) . the rest of the disc is good - but " boogie wonderlan " is in a class by itself ! ! five stars !
280,another solid text from our friend sensei demura . this is part of his popular set on okinawan weaponry and well worth the cost . portrayed in the book is weapon history , basic stances , grips , blocks and strikes . demura also covers self defense applications against many various attacks . for all karate and kobudo students i would reccomend this book
281,the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it 's cheap . i used it on a 1 , 000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it . the navigation is poor . i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was " off route " so often due to the poor maps . the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n't provide a chime when it 's time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n't guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well . but the maps are poor , as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980 's computer generated voice . if you 're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this is n't it . this is going back asap .
282,this battery is not compatible with the the jvc-grd270us video camera . i did get a purchase price refund , but i am out shipping costs both ways
283,i guess it 's cheap , but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight , so it 's pretty hard to get anything more than a ~2-3 pound estimate . which is fine if you 're not obsessive , but most people care about that increment.. .
284,i understand that software companies strive to give new versions of their products " new " or " better " appearances but in my opinion toos and defaults should be recognizable from version to version as much as possible . i have used versions of corel since coreldraw ! 3 i just moved to x3 from 10 and find that the trace tool works better but the mechanism is somewhat cryptic . i would have great sympathy for a buyer that is using it for the first time if they had never used an older version simply because i could only figure it out through past knowledge and trial and error . the results were great but the methodology lacks some of the intuitiveness of the past versions . the pallettes are far less comprehensive thn version 10 's pallettes . i truly wish i had version 8 's pantone pallette back even though it is incomplete it was so much better layed out . i will never understand why black has to be at one end of the pallette and white at the other , waste of time.. . the tools are all there but they appear different . i went to work in x3 fright away and found i could work effectively on day one but i did resort to version 10 ( which i have kept on my system ) a few times in the first week to perform operations that i coupd n't figure out in x3 which were simple in 10. the help files are circuitous , apparently never actually getting to the point . the on line tutorials are great for the absolute novice but useless to anyone who actually has worked with vector art before . the export to ai is still a little inaccurate even after all these years . ( you cannot select a line terminus and expect it to be there in ai ) the eps export filter does n't always want to be readable in adobe either . the price is excellent , the product spectacular in its own right and i am happy with my purchase . i expected a little more in this version than i got but no less than i had with additional compatibility . i still need to have a copy of illustrator on my machine to deal with people who have only that program
285,if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust . the grindhouse release is well worth the money . however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful . the picture quality is horrendous . the movie is lacking any redeemable quality . there are a few violent moments , but just a few . one of the absolute worst italian horror / exploitation films made . if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films , then ferox is the plan 9.
286,ok , i know i 'm going to get hammered for this ; once again , there goes my reviewer rating . but i just have to be honest : this is a terrible story . ok , being that it 's shakespeare , it 's prettily told , but it 's still a horrible story , and i ca n't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it . perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek ( it is a comedy , after all ) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not ; that would almost make it tolerable , if i could believe it . but given that it is a shakespearean comedy , we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a " happy " one , and the situation at the end is far from pleasant . or perhaps people believe ( i 've heard this claimed in all seriousness ) that kate has actually " triumphed " at the end , having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly . even if this were true , i 'd hardly consider it a " happy " anding , and personally , i see little evidence of it . no , what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman ( some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it ) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who " tames " her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse ( he does n't beat her , simply starves her and sleep-deprives her , as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants , up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives . her spirit may or may not be broken , depending on how the part is played , but the fact remains that she 's forced to behave as if it is , and that 's not a message that should be bruited about in a " comedy " . this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare 's plays
287,at least this author mentions the " mockery " strategy martha / mdiddy tried to use to " fog " the public . the " real issue " of whether martha / mdiddy committed the crimes , and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question " did martha stewart " lie , demonstrates some complacency . is it this complacency martha / mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote ? is it the " greyness " of white-collar crime that martha / mdiddy was trying to play on ? is society the ultimate judge about a person 's guilt or innocence ? if so , what has martha / mdiddy been judged ? be " thoughtful " ~shaw
288,does not maintain water temp . splashes all over at the proper water level . rollers hurt . noisy . weak vibrations . i would n't want one for $5
289,apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film , but when i re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so , i found it to be . . . well , nearly unwatchable . what 's so bad about it ? well , how shall i begin . . . ( 1 ) sean connery is a dud . there can be very little doubt that connery is the james bond , but here , he seems like he 's just going through the motions . to be fair , he had no decent material to play . the only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007 ; he seems suitably worn-out at various points , and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before . but these are grace notes ; by and large , connery is stiff as a board here . ( 2 ) the action scenes are uninspiring . i 'm not the biggest fan of the roger moore bond films , but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes . here , the action is strictly second-rate . ( 3 ) kim basinger and barbara carrera , though great to look at , give terrible performances . ( 4 ) there is literally no reason to see this in favor of " thunderball , " of which it is a remake ; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments , and this remake makes zero improvements . in fact , the plot merely becomes muddled . ( 5 ) there are a series of awful performances in supporting roles . rowan atkinson 's comic scenes , though brief , are painfully unfunny , not to mention out of place . the actor playing the " new " m is odious ; and whoever it is playing q is n't very good , either . ( 6 ) the music is bad . the title song is boring , and the score by michel legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a bugs bunny cartoon . i could n't care less that the james bond theme is missing ; it 's not what is n't there that 's bad , it 's what is there . all in all , i 'd have to say that - - unless we 're counting the 1967 version of " casino royale " - - this is the worst of the james bond movies . it 's worth seeing if you 've never seen it before . . . but that 's about it , in my opinion
290,always loved this group....own several of their cd 's and this is by far my favorite . darryl hall 's phrasing of his songs are superb .
291,it seems the last few office releases i have purchased have n't really offered anything different , but this one does . the interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to . i would suggest upgrading to office 2007 when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project . the new toolbars seem to be really thought out and are very user friendly . if you are n't into change and prefer the status quo of the standard , file edit tools...layout , then this product is not for you . if you are willing to spend a couple hours getting used the new layout ( it 's quite easy ) you wo n't be sorry because it 's well worth it .
292,although each track is beautiful in it 's own way , it 's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind . where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album , black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo . the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey , and , personally , like a lay 's potato chip , not able to listen to just one....yeah , i need the whole thing. .
293,i purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep . well folks this is not what happened at all . i turned on my conair su1w and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day . about 5 minutes into my relaxation i almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck . the volume which seemed to have been controlled by satan reached top volume , although i never had touched it myself . i tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring . i unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times , and still it would not work
294,this book is very disappointing , as is most of gunaratna 's work on islamist terrorism . it 's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear , ie . bin laden and aq are everywhere , responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups ( such as ji ) are aq franchises - total bollocks . the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a " scholar " who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary
295,the camera worked fine ; however , after six months , it stopped working . i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism . my use was in no way abusive . i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage , until i gave it away . i guess i should have stayed with canon . i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight , but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it
296,the product is easy to use . like how it intergrates with ms office applications . it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients
297,the first time i tried to use this tool the spring came off and would not reattach . the screw holding the spring on was defective . what a dissappointment ! !
298,in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts , the d70s has fallen behind the pack . ( however , if that 's the only measure by which you 're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it 's quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it 's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it 's category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade 's worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800. - nikon 's raw software and control software are n't included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ...and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages.. . ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc. ) with modes that you could customize
299,half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless . should have sent it back
300,its a very nice little fountain . the lighting on the ceiling is really cool and the water noises are adjustable depending on how you arrange the rocks . it does n't have near enough rocks , so i 'm going to go and get some , but i think once i fill it up a little more it 'll look a lot better too . i 'm satisfied , i actually bought another one :
301,we started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town . as babies sometimes do , she began screaming and was unconsolable.. . until we turned on rocket ship beach . polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so . we played that song at least 6 times in a row that day ! now that she 's a little older , she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing , requesting her cd be played . i 've always enjoyed a wide range of music , and was afraid that after having a child , we 'd be reduced to listening to watered down " kid music " like that purple dinosaur and those australian guys . there is a mixture of classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all of the time . there is a good variety of instrumentation and styles . our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often waves her arms about . got kids ? buy this cd !
302,the beats is cool , but you understand his lyrics ! & amp ; its not bout all that pimp trash ! snoop not a pimp...but this is a bangin c
303,i regret having purchased this product . i have not been able to use it for two months , after finally giving up trying to get it to work . i have a very nice laptop running windows xp home , and encountered many problems . i tried all of the avenues available to me through quickbooks , online , via email , and on the telephone . i spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of . here are just a few : the program would not convert my quicken data ; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product ; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid ; none of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info , after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks . i spent 2 & 1 / 2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue . part of the problem lies in the fact that i was unable to speak to a customer service person who 's first language was english . each time i was on the phone , the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem , then he / she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try , then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was . not helpful in any way , though very polite . i 'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed , convoluted , over-complicated , non-user-friendly item which i would like to toss over a cliff .
304,i 've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment , and i figured this would suit my mopping needs . it hasn't . even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the wetjet , i 've found that it does n't really pick any dirt up . what i wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere . i 'm even using the " special " hardwood floor solution - it is n't making a difference . i do n't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor ( and there are probably better solutions for that as well )
305,i 've had my son in huggies brand since he was born . i started out with newborns and just went up in size . i loved them and they never sagged ( unless they were really full ) . i loved the trim look to them . when i had to get pampers brand because the store was out , the pampers brand always looked like he had a full sagging load . even if i had just put them on and they were dry ! when my son was 1 , he decided to take off the " tape " on the daipers and he just would not keep it on . so i switched him to pull ups . he kept those on and has been in pull ups for 3 years . sometimes they did leak at night , because he went too much , but if i changed him once a night he was fine . now that he 's older , i do n't have to change him , because he does n't go at night . these are really best out there , and they do n't look like they are always sagging like other diapers
306,this was perhaps the best of johannes steinhoff 's books , since it does not deal with his own stellar yet tragic ww ii and post war career . the insights of the average person living in germany are of great importance to both social and military historians alike . steinhoff offered this collective testament as a warning to all of us regarding war and the rise of a dictator . as johannes said in an interview , & quot ; it is always the civilians who suffer the most , yet are remembered the least . &quot
307,if you want some classical music to sleep to , do n't buy this cd . if you want some high energy symphonies , however , i highly recommend it . from bach to vivaldi , the pure energy of this cd will give you a new understanding of the joys of classical music . just do n't listen to track 25 , because i have no idea why john philip sousa is included with tchaichovsky
308,i guess in this book you can see both the good qualities of ayn rand as well as some of her non-desirable traits . good gateway book before tackling on the big and long atlas shrugged
309,turbo tax is fine . the linking into quickbooks pro ( qbp ) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of qbp . so if you have an older version ( older than 2005 ) you have to buy the new qbp to have turbo tax lift the data out of qb . now intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 - no more ungrades . " for the consumer " they will tell you . bs , i will be changing accounting platforms as soon as i can find a replacement . this is the problem with software oligolopies ! an open source replacement is much needed for both tax prep and accounting .
310,photos printed are very sharp . some difficulty with printer cartidge and as expensive as they are , you ca n't afford to have much difficulty . good for craft times with the kids
311,the guy below is right . the blades are so far down it wo n't cut anything but really long hairs . how could this make it through any product test ? i tossed mine in the garbage .
312,photos were excellent . but photo print quality depends very much on the print shop . for the same photo file , it can look like a 4m photo when taken to a below quality printer shop . photos taken indoor with marginal lighting ( no flash used ) turned out to be yellowish . battery life is very long despite its large 3 " lcd . battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long . photos files viewed on computer looks just great . 8'x10 ' prints are great but have not tried larger prints . touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set . date on photo is red ( would be better if it is black ) . and the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner
313,lee smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist , ready if needs be , to question cherished assumptions . one is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people the book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory , where he initially states , as he sees it , the five big problems in physics . in this context , he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970 's there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and , in particular , he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough . in making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics . but then he builds up his case against the theory . he says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model , probably the most successful theory in physics , but even predicts particles not seen in nature . it did not predict and does not cater for dark energy , nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions . in particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics . he also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory . he shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed , but notes that this theory , m theory , still remains a tantalizing conjecture . he says hopes for a unique string theory have receded . this reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes , are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader . indeed new ideas are needed in physics as lee smolin says . we are missing something big . there is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the ` murk ' into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature . the clues are there . to do this , lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed . he also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not . and whether it is ` lateral ' thinking or a breakthrough revolution in ` conceptual ' thinking , new thinking is definitely required . lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that . he chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation . a good choice perhaps . i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book , if they have not already done so .
314,i did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly , but it 's a fantastic game . you get a building with your waiting room , exam room , living room , and bedroom . you build animal pens outside , buy medical equipment , buy books to learn about caring for each species , and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals , sleep , eat , and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed , care for , play with , and clean up after . it 's a fun and well designed game
315,i am reading this for a college course called " history of the american city " . this book is a typical ' college texbook ' in that it is filled with numbers , dates , percentages , figures , numbers , oh did i say numbers , dates , figures , and years , oh and plenty of numbers.. . the brilliant , dilligent , honored , and esteemed scolar of a woman that wrote it sure knows her numbers , facts , years , etc.. . i , on the other hand , am absolutley hating it and foolishly i have allowed the drop date to pass , so i have to read the book or fail the class . i am getting nothing from the book regarding any kind of understanding of any of these cities , unless i am willing to spend years interpreting the multitude of data the book heaps upon me . needless to say , from ( attempting ) reading it i am getting a headache and do n't really even have the time to write this review . i say that if even one person is deterred from reading this expose ' of numbers , names , dates , figures , facts , percentages , orders , years , dates and more numbers , dates , facts , figures ( are you getting my drift yet ? ) , it will be time well served though.- - - avoid- - - this- - - book . please - - find another book . maybe if people told the truth about this brand of writing , more professors might have to teach and people like ms. abu-lughod would n't continue to make money off of writing books such as this , and folks like her might have to write to communicate ! ! ! ! , like the rest of us.thank you for taking the time to read this . ok , i have to say it : this sucks .
316,a really cool digital picture frame , very simple to use and supports all types of memory cards even a pen drive
317,before that it was kind of nice , but it cannot focus in even semi-low light . it is definitely light and easy to take everywhere , but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing . no way i would call the output hd quality , just the best sd ever with a 16 * 9 format . and then it broke
318,very few people remember sandra bullock starring on the short-lived cbs sitcom working girl which was based on the 1988 20th century fox film of the same title starring harrison ford , melanie griffith and sigourney weaver . very few remember bullock 's appearance in the 1991 film love potion #9. this film catapulted her to superstardom . she stars opposite keanu reeves and all hell breaks loose with both of them recklessly driving commercial buses . in the twelve years since this film debuted on the big screen , bullock relentlessly made films to this very day . also back in 1994 , hollywood had another megastar , jim carrey whose starring debut ace ventura-pet detective grossed over $5 million at the box office . unfortunately , speed 2 , released in 1997 , never acuumulated audiences as large as the ones who saw the first film
319,maggie gyllenhaal played her part to perfection , scarily so . she 's the perfect sociopath , only thinking of herself while using her daughter , as well as anyone else she encounters , as a foil . she 's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path . all in all a real slice of life film accurately depicted , directed and played
320,the product features are ok , but the screen is very small . also , the resolution needs to be better . the photos were very grainy . an impressive looking product with not so impressive output
321,i 'm not a tech guy . but from a simple user 's standpoint , there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance . about 1 / 2 the software you might have purchased that worked with xp wo n't work with vista . i was thinking that vista would be an improvement . but there is nothing there . just some minor superficial changes as far as i can tell . maybe for it people , there might be some big difference , but for your average user , there is no improvement at all . save your money . do n't buy it .
322,i love dancehall queen ! i lost my first copy ( vhs ) so i replaced it with a new copy in dvd . i never get tired of watching this movie and i consider it a jamaican movie classic right up there with harder they come , rockers and smile orange . it is a nice twist on the traditional rags-to-riches story . although her character 's morals are somewhat questionable ( she practically " sells " her daughter to a high-paying local don ) , you ca n't help but root for the protagonist marcia
323,sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie , but peter sellers did many better films than this . " dr. strangelove " was the masterpiece . " being there " is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in washington . " the world of henry orient " ( at last on dvd ! ) is priceless but virtually unknown , with delicious performances from sellers and especially his teenage tormentors . finally , the " pink panther " series is much better slapstick than " after the fox , " which has many famous , talented participants but is mostly silly , unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as clouseau & co. one irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations , as if we might not notice them otherwise . i agree with other reviewers that victor mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted , and martin balsam does okay with his stuff , too . when watching this film , i kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant - - i could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money
324,this was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film i kept looking at my watch , the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about william shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama . my girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but i was n't in the mood she forced me to watch this , the film was about a struggling young writer shakespeare played by joseph fiennes who falls in love with lady viola played by gwyneth paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play romeo and juliet , this film also won a couple of oscars including gwyny for best actress but i felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old english style thats hard to understand . overall the film was just o.k. i think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and judi dench was great as queen elizabeth but i never want to watch this film again , if your a shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than i did .
325,it 's time to switch to any product but a symantec one : what was once the best security software company for pc users is now the worst . it was time to upgrade my systemworks premier to the 2007 version , so i checked out the ' 07 features online . but where was password manager ? hell , i have 187 passwords and logins i depend upon password manager to fill in - - at least 30 of them a day . after an hour on the phone with allegedly ' english-speaking ' symantec csr 's in bombay , the story i got was that customer surveys prompted them to ' drop ' password manager . not being stupid , i said , ' let me guess , symantec 's going to roll out a stand-alone password manager to extort another $40 from me' . ' oh , no , sir , no , no.. . ' and here it is : a $[...] rip-off , nothing but password manager - - not so cleverly disguised as ' the vault ' - - along with other features ie7 provides for free , and marketed as a ' new ' online security program . symantec seems to put more effort into playing marketing games with their customers than they do into making the programs they sell work correctly . norton anti-virus is a mess ; it 's once-a-week wednesday night updates are now a joke : launch your attack , release your new virus on a thursday morning and you 'll have millions of nav subscribers at your mercy for at least a week . three times in the past few months , nav has failed to stop an attack - - after several years of never failing . systemworks too seems to be causing more problems than it solves ( i 'm continually rolling back to undo ' fixes ' one button checkup or windoctor creates , after the ' fix ' crashes my system ) . goodbye , norton , hello mcafee - - or anybody else . this rip-off - - deleting password manager from systemworks only to regurgitate it as this bug-filled mess called norton confidential - - is the last straw
326,bought this as an xmas present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel . i 'm now on the 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w / phillips ) , and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external ( in my case , sony memory sticks ) . the internal memory is pitiful , and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it , you are not going to be able to hold very many internally . i 've yet to get the auto on / off feature to work , and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device , it 's certainly not always mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with , and the directions meager . i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag , the fact that the support stand ca n't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course , no mention of this in the product description . also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - no support for the new , ms produo sticks ( and no mention of that in the product descriptions either ) i thought i would get a quality product from phillips , and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately , it 's turned out to be a piece of junk , one i 've been screwing around with for so long that it 's probably not returnable . do n't waste your time and dollars...................... .
327,i resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years . i make it 200. the other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler . i just loved the u.s air force personnel with scottish and english accents . they must have overrun the $500 budget at that point .
328,this cable did not fit my camera as stated . because of the cost factor , i chose not to return it . the shipping was more than the cable was worth
329,the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards . i bought it for future use , as i do n't currently have the lens yet , but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too
330,this film i have to say is beautiful looking , from the characters to the landscape . although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes , it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects . the only problem is the love between the two main characters . the movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway i mean it is called heart under blade right ? the main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it . this film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals !
331,acronis true image 10.0 home is really great for making backups and moving entire partitions to a new disk . very easy , foolproof , and dependable . good product. . good price
332,or in their entire career for that matter . i have tried to like this band , but greg dulli just wo n't shut up . every song is his snide lyrical diatribing , on and on and on . the guitarist keeps things mildly interesting , but on this album in particular , the drummer also wo n't shut up and play a straight beat for once . it 's like three guys in their own worlds , and they mash it together and call what they 've done songs . except for the one decent song they did , the only rock song i can think of that is hard , psychedelic , passionate , powerful , and set to a waltz beat of all things . " let me lie to you " is the best song they ever made , because everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song 's framework and tempo . instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do , everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses , and it 's less muddled and better orchestrated for it . it 's a shame they did n't do any other songs like this , at least none that i have heard . i tried to like them , i really did . i wanted to find the band that made that one song , and discover a whole treasure chest of dark , passionate , noisy music like that . too bad , no wonder they drifted apart
333,this dvd was a waste of money and a waste of time . it 's " unauthorized " by muse , so therefore there were no interviews , no live footage , and none of their music was included . they interviewed people who had never even met the band . i learned nothing new from watching it . do n't waste your money
334,ordered two frames from the third party source . neither on of them worked at all . it has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund
335,' introducing postmodernism ' is a good source to gather names of philosophers , architects , artists , anthropologists , linguists , and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to pm . the problem , and it is a big one , is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines . sure , if you only have half an hour to read up on pm , you can whip through this book and go on with your life . but if you 're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon , and perhaps go on to read more , this book is not the place to start . check out david harvey 's ' condition of postmodernism . ' this will rip the top of your head clean off ! it 's much more weighty ( in every sense of the word ) , but your understanding of pm will vastly improve , and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the ' genre '
336,after carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on amazon and reading all reviews i had hoped i had made a good choice with this cd . unfortunately i discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my bose tri-port headphones . as a recording engineer i recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground . the bottom line is i hear this rumble each and everytime i start to relax and it renders the cd completely useless to me . the recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic . since nobody else has complained of this rumble , i will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear
337,we received it with broken cover . it did n't work properly and stopped running every hour . we tried different ways to make it run , but nothing worked . we 've returned it . it 's just waste of money . on the other hand the cow-humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well . no complaints
338,this movie ended where tyrese gibson and meagan good meet up again in mexico . but heck , they are both fugitives hiding from the law . how is this a proper happy ending ? although , i will admit , meagan good is a fine looking young lady . just knowing that she was in this film , got me to want to watch it . however , i do n't understand the appeal of these kinds of films . violent " black / gangsta " films with lots of foul language , gun-play , and just bad tempered attitudes . even that music sounds like it would stir up hatred and provoke violence and harm to anyone just passing by . i wish people would get rid of that " what are you looking at ? " mentality that just seems to encourage fear to innocent people just passing by . my wife is asian , and her older sister married an hispanic guy . we go to their house every thanksgiving and christmas . nothing makes my holidays more depressing than to have to go over to his house and have to watch these violent " gangsta " movies , with his kids . i 'm trying to teach my kids to not have any prejudices of other races , but these kinds of films make the black race look bad . there was n't very many positive messages in this movie . and if black people are so offended by the use of the " n " word , then why do they keep using it themselves ? if it 's such an offensive term , then they need to stop using it themselves . these kinds of movies promote and glorify the ugly side of being black in the " big city " . black people need to do more movies with more " positive " themes . we gotta work together if we 're going to diminish our black and white prejudices . i wish my brother-in-law would stop having this kind of crap on his tv when i have my children over . it 's hard to talk to him about it , especially when he thinks there is nothing wrong with our kids watching these kinds of films . what 's more , it 's hard to reason with someone that has to use the " f " word in every sentence . i 'm really beginning to struggle with my prejudices within my own family .
339,great music , great band . this is a must buy . recommended to all hard rock lovers
340,there 's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod . but for $16 the sima smp-1 is a tremendous value . i have a sony dsc-w5 digital camera and have done everything i can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos . this monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry . the key is that it is small enough and light enough that i can take it almost wherever i go . and because it 's so small , i can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod . a monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod . but this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that i take on trips
341,i was thoroughly disappointed . the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed - - words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site , first fogware had not sent me a coupon , then i had to deal with bad customer service ( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support ) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box , the online info is exactly what we have in the cd - - so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out
342,the author is reusing a similar plot device than in " twisted " : a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything . that is a poor strategy for a mystery novel , because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes . the narrative in general is not kellerman at his best , either . the characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do . a small part of the book talks about brazil , and kellerman simply invents a couple of portuguese words making them sound spanish : ( " favilla " , " favillitos " ) . one wonders how much of the author 's research is similarly fictional . in sum , a book carelessly executed
343,i love this razor...it gives a nice close shave , is easy to clean and can be used wet or dry . nothing to complain about here
344,this product would be excellent but runs fully 4 " too narrow and 3 " too short . this creates an aprox . 2 " lip around the entire matress . very odd . this short coming disturbs the experience substantially . the laminated back works well . be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine
345,this is a good little product . did not expect much , but in fact it helped me relax and fall asleep and stay asleep . - thank
346,this product hurts and ripps out your hair when you use it . it also leaves ur hair smelling bur n't and smokey . when you go out and it is humid ur hair will go back to its normal self and get very frizzy . the only good thing is that it does not break easily
347,bought two of these . one as a gift and one for myself . luckily i tried mine out before i gave the other away . this thing just vibrates . no massage at all ! ! after 30 seconds you get nausea...its not worth 23.99...its a piece of junk . trust me you are not getting a bargain . i guess you pay for what you get , but in this case i ca n't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub .
348,i love to read great books like brave new world by aldous huxley or far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy . i love the aeneid by virgil , the odyssey by homer . i read both long versions of les miserables and the hunchback of norte dame by victor hugo . i read the rise and fall of the roman empire by gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so . i love to read . but great expectations was a great disappointment ! i was somewhat amused until chapter ten where i felt the book became psycho-babble . i was also disappointed in tale of two cities . i could not endure the first two chapters ! dickens did a fine job on the christmas carol . but i will never read another of his books
349,i was quite disappointed by this book , i was expecting something with more professional level content . it 's all very amateur however , the artwork used in the examples is sub-professional at best . i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific pre-press issues relating to comics artwork , but the chapter there was frustratingly slight . you would be much better to buy a a more general pre-press book . the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much
350,goo
351,i first read about this wonderful book on one of the services that provides reading guides for book clubs . i was intrigued by the premise , and knew i had to buy it . this is one book that did not let me down ! i was captivated from the moment i began . i read in greed , hungering for the next diary entry . i completed it much too quickly , and had to re-read some entries . i found myself wondering about some of the women . ( many are still on my mind . ) i am so pleased that book two is in the works . this is a book that is too good to miss .
352,it never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months . do n't buy , you 've been warned
353,i never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but i love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are american country music songs . ca n't say i 'm much of a fan of american country music so was just a bit disappointed . i think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the cd . was also disappointed that danny elfman 's desperate housewives theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it . the desperate housewives theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the tv show mentioning wisteria lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds . what ligic was there in not making this a separate track ? you would then be able to memory it out on your stereo . i like listening to tv themes and i find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds . this cd is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but i guess if you 're just buying it for the theme song you 'll have to wait for some other new tv theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own . this album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show .
354,the software was installed flawlessly . programs have worked successfully and been exactly what i need and wanted
355,very clear pictures , very happy with this camera . note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder , but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use
356,this book is loaded with the most recent medical findings and is organized as a referenced book , although i read it cover to cover .
357,this book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all . you could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did . book doesnt show you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them . it also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor did n't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses . it is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used .
358,i saw wirey spindell in theater in new york , and i thought itwas awesome ! i had never heard of it before , but it is a trueendorsement of indie films . if you love laughing , you 'll love this movie . i loved devin matthews-johnson and eric mabius too , they 're both so cute
359,works great but i wish i could find it in stores . the one riteaid that does carry it , does n't always have it in stock . i also can not always find it in just any rite aid . some do n't carry it at all...annoying ! my daughter is the canker sore sufferer . i did some research before i discovered rembrandt , and found that the ingredient , sodium lauryl sulfate , found in almost all toothepastes is the culprate . rembrandt for canker sores does not contain this key ingredient . sodium lauryl sulfate ( sls ) is what makes our toothepaste foam . my daughter hardly ever has anymore canker sore breakouts . if she does , it seems to be from getting a cold . try and find a toothpaste without sls...they are n't out there . it would be nice to have some competition to bring the price down and be more readily available . but all in all , i 'm glad someone has made this product available , even if it 's pricey and hard to find .
360,if you are looking for a great all around camera , this is it ! our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all . also love the " last 4 " feature , gets some great action shots . we had the fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me . love the new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) as well as the battery drain . i used to have to replace batteries every day , now its more like once a week with the amount we use it . my other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where i forget to put it back in the camera after downloading ! so there is always one in there ! . the video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots . in general , without spending a lot more , you get a great camera that keeps up with an active " picture happy " family
361,systemic mechanic 6 seemed to be helping , since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well . however , the " repair broken shortcuts " function does not work properly . for a variety of reasons i use a large number of microsoft word shortcuts in my folder / file system . system mechanic " repaired broken shortcuts " on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target . now i am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which i have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual , correct target file . this has had severe productivity consequences , since i have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut . contacting on-line help was of no help whatsoever .
362,it 's amazing how a little common sense can turn into a million you know what's . as soon as i tried these i realized how much better they are than the usual throat lozenges . why ? because others cause you to suck on them , and this strains your throat muscles , which is bad . gummi lozenges , it 's genius . why did n't i think of it . then again , i did , but i did n't create airborne which is wonderful in itself . really , these lozengers are great . at night if you use one they just stay pretty much stuck to the side of your throat and you can fall asleep without even the thought that you could shallow it and choke . just remember how long it takes for a normal lozenge to disolve without bitting it ( even then ) . these go pretty quick , and without crewing ( which is the best way to use them ) . i myself try to always have them in the house . you should , and will do the same after you try them . also the price on amazon is the best . i 'm about to order 10 boxes ( would order more but for the shipping charge , which even with is still cheaper then target ) . maybe the owner should put me on the payroll .
363,i bought this from ioniczone themselves . it does not work . i kept it on for an entire month , the filter was never dirty at all . also , this unit is extremely small , the pic is rather misleading i was however able to return the unit to the office in nv , had to make 2 phone calls and the person was very polite . i went on to buy one from ionicpro , and what a difference it was , filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so and it was really dirty .
364,i figured for the price , how could you go wrong ? well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether . no hot air , no cold air...nothing ! ! this item looks like a great deal..but save your $$$ and buy something that will last you longer than 2-1 / 2 months . the manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product !
365,i deinstall the product after two weeks of use . it did not allow me to select adobe reader as my default program and was not able to open many pdf documents . if a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing . also , the feature to allow editing of the documents in word or excel was most often non-functional
366,i purchased panda internet security 2007 for two reasons : the price after rebates ( free ) and the fact that it is a 3-user license . after switching from mcafee to norton ( and a subsequent 1-year renewal ) i decided to either buy pc-cillin 2007 or try panda . ( 39.99 or free...hmm.. . ) i installed panda on my laptop first ( after uninstalling norton internet security 2005 ) . no problem what-so-ever . in the initial hdd scan , panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm . i then installed panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either . panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second . panda boots up with windows xp quickly . it has only given me a couple of pop-up messages ( one for a wifi intrusion , which was another computer on my network...i accepted it and it never came back . the other pop-up was to start on-line customer service or something like that...i declined it and it has yet to come back . ) my laptop is a p4 1.8ghz , 1gb ram , 32mb ati video , 40gb hdd . the initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes , scanning over 250 , 000 files . not bad ! desktop 1 's first scan ( p4 2.4ghz , 512mb , 128mb video , 120gb hdd ) scanned nearly 300 , 000 files also under 20 minutes . desktop 2 was the quickest ( p4 3.4ghz , 1gb , 128mb video , 80gb hdd ) scanning over 330 , 000 files in about 15 minutes . i am extremely impressed with panda internet security 2007. it 's everything i hoped it would be . i would definitely recommend this product to others
367,we use the zbars for breakfast , and my kids love them ! i love them too , as they 're organic , contain no trans fat , no refinded sugar or flour . they 're yummy and healthy
368,my paperback copy fell to pieces after ten days ! it is full of nice photographs but when the individual pages are lying in a chaotic heap on the floor it hardly matters how pretty the pictures are or how intelligent the text is , does it
369,i purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself . the person for whom i purchased them is very happy with them and so am i . i was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because i have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour . it is too soon to tell but i hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands .
370,you will save a lot of time by using this ocr . top notch accuracy and very easy to use . a must for all those who need an ocr . do n't hesitate
371,as you can see by other reviews above , the studio series has a history of being buggy . you also hear a lot of people saying " this package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other ' powerful enough to be worth owning ' packages - - if only it were more stable ! " i am one of those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back to version 9 ) , and finally with version 10.6 i have stopped complaining - - it now works as i 'd hoped when i bought it . the $300 i spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted - - i kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual could n't clarify . and i 'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures . i am turning all of our old family video tapes and cd 's into dvd's . i use studio for all the editing ( have not tried the dvd recording - - just use roxio for that ) and am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download . one important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems : put every " project " you work on in a separate subdirectory . if you have 5 soccer game videos make a / game1 , / game2 etc. series of subfolders . if you edit those to a " jimmy 's great plays " proect , put it in a separate / jimmyplays folder . when projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5. i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , and i do n't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why did i stick with something where i admit that version 9.0 was " powerful but unstable " and 10.0 was " more powerful and more unstable " ? because i can actually use studio with minimal reference to instructions , and when i use it things turn out as i expect . now that it has become stable and reliable i am a very satisfied customer . so that 's how i got from being a frustrated studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review . i tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions , but that " 10.5 updated for free to 10.6 " really is the best choice out there now.. . as my unused expensive rivals to studio on my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !
372,i used the product at victoris falls and was very pleased . at this time i have not gone under water with it .
373,.. with an all-star cast . the plot is not new ( stage door , how to marry a millionaire and valley of the dolls to mention but a few ) , but judy , hedy and lana do an admirable job . never mind highbrow critcs ; hedy lamarr wasn ` t that bad and lana does one of her best acting jobs ever . judy is a tomboy and it ` s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of lana ` s character sheila . the musical numbers are good , but sadly ; footage from the great ziegfeld are edited in ( note the finale ) . james stewart are good as well - as are edvard everett horton , charles winninger and eve arden . the film is filled with good 1-liners and there are even echoes of garbo ` s first sound-entrance in anna christie
374,wow was that ever awful ! i 'd write more but im busy cleansing my dvd player after loading that steaming pile ! !
375,this camera is perfect for me i have a [...] an a [...] an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film . this camcorder is small enough that some days i have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go . also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed . the settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use . it takes really good video 's an pictures although ive not taken alot of still pictures because i like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip . this camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc . ive got a few 2 gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go . the battery does not last a long time so i recommend a couple extra , there pretty cheep here on amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your pc for any lengh of time . i dont know anything about camera 's an how they work i just like to take the pictures an so far this has been the easiest camera / camcorder ive seen
376,i have been using the family tree maker products for a number of years . i love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts . i am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder . i feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly , both visually and functionally
377,turbo tax deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item . also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return . it 's very annoying to find and adjust the state return once you have gone back into your federal return . i think it is a very good product but they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas especially for the state return
378,i like wordperfect much better than microsoft word as it is easier to use . reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave . not available in word . i bought the x3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12. , like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems . the price was right on amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12. i do n't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that i was having in 12. if an earlier version is working for you , i see no good reason to upgrade . b
379,i was also disappointed with this dvd , as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers . i think the title , " yoga for beginners " is misleading , as this dvd contains many advanced yoga routines . also , on the back of the dvd it said it contained a " core workout 20 min . " but no such workout is actually on the dvd ! i purchase the " pilates for inflexible people " at the same time as this dvd , and i much prefer it . although , i wish i 'd known that two of the workouts from the pilates dvd were on the yoga dvd before i bought them both .
380,this low carb cookbook gives some new twists on old recipes , and explains the mysterious ingredients , etc. that other low carb books do n't
381,great deal , great price , great product . emedia guitar method is by far one of the greatest computer learn to play programs out there . my order netted me a brand new , factory fresh product , securely and quickly shipped . thanks , again
382,i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers . it has improved with this version . i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best . for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program . what it claims to do , it does well . if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones . a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program
383,the only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus , especially where there is not adequate light . aside from this it is a good but not great lens . it is probably worth the money that it cost , however , i believe that a better lens would be the 70 - 300 mm vr which costs about 4x the price of this lens
384,i am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not . my friends and family that i have made cards for think they are the best also . keep making more and more . thank
385,i got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer , and it 's great . as much as i 'd love to have a canon powershot , it 's a bit out of my price range . all the people who think that using the lcd screen runs out the batteries after & quot ; 2-4 pictures&quot ; are lying to you . i bought rechargable batteries from radioshack , and i 've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed . this is a good camera with good quality in good lighting . in dark or overcast situations , it can look a bit grainy , but that 's easily photoshopped . i recommend that when uploading , plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter , because uploading sucks all battery power right out . i recommend this for someone who has n't owned a digital camera before , or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price
386,i have a 2 month old high-end dell pc with tons of memory and disk , running windows xp pro . this game does n't work . period . first of all , when i installed it , it reset my graphics options . second , when i attempt to play a game , even at the settings that it chose , i get nothing but a white screen . after numerous tries , and killing the program with the task manager , i finally attempted the other activities options . clicking on them does absolutely nothing ! it does n't recognize my mouse clicks . i 'm assuming that the game was written for the apple mac , and ported to the pc . trust me , it does n't work . btw , we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them . now i have to figure out how to return this silly thing .
387,this book is another excellant addition to the growing body of knowledge and accessible information on a health problem that plagues many americans . adrenal fatigue and its consequences and causes should become one of the most crucial topics in health maintainance . another excellent book in this vein is dr. j . wilson 's , adrenal fatigue , the 21st century stress syndrome
388,we started getting a " lo " message when using the thermometer . it said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense . this worked for a little while . we changed the tip on each use . now nothing works . after spending near $50 on this i feel like a chump . i want to throw it out the window . i 'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else
389,i have to agree with the other reviews of this scope . i purchased this scope as a christmas gift . when i opened it , the equatorial mount ( the basis for the entire scope ) was broken . i contacted celestron and was promised another part for it , which never arrived . i contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me . it did n't fit . finally , i was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope . the equatorial mount was in 1 piece. . yeah ! too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and i could not assemble this one . i even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support ( who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived ) and all i got was a bunch of excuses . i finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one entire telescope . it 's february and i just now have a product that works . ( i have n't had time to try it though ! ) celestron offered no refunds for this telescope , so buyer beware . if they are not willing to satisfy customers , your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells . good luck
390,right , so , you 're reading this either because you are a big oasis fan and realize that this album is wonderful , or because you 've heard some oasis songs on the ever-disappointingly-dull radio and it 's sparked yer interest . " the masterplan " is a compilation of oasis b-sides that have been released over the years . what has always made oasis the best band in the world is the fact that the songs that they include on their " albums proper " are not necessarily their best songs . as such , songs like " acquiesce " , " talk tonight " and " stay young " are vacant on their albums , yet they represent the best of this lovely band and are included here in stunning fashion . so in summary , i absolutely do not recommend you buy this album until you at least own and fall in love with " definitely maybe " and " morning glory " . to those who own and love this album , it is a part of rock history and is not to be overlooked .
391,you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but it 's actually the opposite . i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school . this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people...this movie is the real thing , i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too
392,i was so upset after i finished reading this book . i wish it was n't updated and they just kept it in its original version . if you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values , this is the wrong book . read bushido : the soul of japan . the code of the samurai really felt like the code of the japanese business man
393,roni griffith has just come out with her new release " only you " its great ! ! ! ! ! [...]she has come back so much stronger . check it out . evi
394,if you want the original recordings , do n't purchase any volume of television 's greatest hits . i 've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc . these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of " the beverly hillbillies " and " the munsters " that just do n't sound right to me . if the original recordings do n't matter to you , then you may like this cd
395,the fact that this has had no us release was an immediate warning .... however as a longtime fan i figured i would check it out . boy is this bad . there are a few decent tracks , however the truly awful " crazy little thing called love " , " this magic moment " , " only you " - among many others - make this unlistenable . miss ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the billie holliday material . she is a producer 's singer : ashford and simpson , chic , holland dozier holland - even hall & oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics . this is a mess . diana , your voice still sounds great - stop executive producing your projects
396,his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics . he has an eclectic mix of love songs , " we are the world " type songs and a few others on this album . he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes . i loved streetcorner symphony ! it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me . lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one ! enjoy this album - i sure do
397,i 'm sure it 's a good product for beginners , but i already had an older version of quickbooks ( from 1995 ) and the only way i could export / import the old data into a newer version of quickbooks was with qb pro . simple start does n't allow you to import data from older versions
398," animal house " raised the bar , and set a standard for all comedies that followed . many have tried to duplicate the originality of this movie , and all have failed to come close . a classic for the ages
399,when i considered purchasing this product , i was confused to see that some people thought it was great , and others thought it was terrible . i could n't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews . after i bought it i understood : for some of the things it does , it works fine - - no problems . however , there are many major bugs in the software , and if you need one of the buggy functions , you 'll be sorry you bought it . examples of some problems : 1. if you burn an audio track entitled " blue fog " nero will give it the title " fog . " 2. every time i run a backup , it tells me there was a write error , but the backup seems ok . 3. i backed up every file on my drive , but when my system crashed , there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system . 4. it has blue screened my system one time . 5. many commands are poorly or not at all documented . for example , the wave editor has a declipper function , but there is no documentation on how to use it . so , i 'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product . good luck
400,i purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models , since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat . the scale part works normal , but the body fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30% , compared to tanita bc554 scale or omron hbf-306c hand held . omron , replaced the unit , but the new one is also inaccurate . now , i 'm tying to get my money refunded , but omron does not want to take the unit back
401,i have looked everywhere for this charger . everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that might work . it was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera . it 's just the right size and plugs right into the wall . the prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry-on bag . thanks so much for having this item available
402,i bought this the year it came out , after seeing george in concert and it is great ! most of these were big hit songs and i found that i really loved the others too especially hard day
403,this ancient jazz classic never sounded better.rudy van gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24 - bit.he proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic . just keep them coming rudy
404,ridiculous plot , one dimensional cardboard-like acting ( especially leon lai 's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance ) , incoherent dialogs , horrible editing and directing , every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one . the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment . the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline . nothing deep but shallow all the way . just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves , long sleeves , and black cloak , even the white pigeons turned out to be dead . nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat . nothing at all . curtain call , drop it sooner than later .
405,i love the sludge and the roar but the vocals are monotone and the lyrics laughable . gimme earth or sunno ) ) ) anyday
406,this monitor worked pretty well for 4 months . we purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver . however , when we were downstairs ( baby 's room upstairs next to our 's ) the monitor was fuzzy , and had static and lines running thru . we were still able to have audio recpetion . after 4 months , the picture disappeared , audio was still operational . not a good camera for long term
407,this is the best ! ! ! drys you off fast , and drys fast too. . so soft and comfy on my skin ! !
408,i became interested in this after trying a more advanced program for my business . after weeding through too many option that did n't apply , i knew i just needed somthing simple- - a good way to monitor money in , money out . this program is simple and easy to adjust if you make a mistake . i highly recommend it , as it is exactly as described
409,this remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me . i used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor . ouch . however , the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor . the design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils . i have owned norelco and braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave
410,when my boyfriend bought this for me i was so happy and i remember i would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark , starry nights and i would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights , but by the music she sang and how she deeply , richly portrayed those songs . she really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well . i totally recommend this cd to start if you have not heard much of her music...she truly is addicting once you hear these songs...these songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey
411,i really like omniform 5. actually i 'm using version 5.1 and i 'm very satisfied with it . i was using another forms program i had purchased that was adequate but not nearly as good . after using formtool i have a much greater appreciation of omniform . scansoft has been on my list of not to buy software recently because of some of the poor performance of some of their other programs , tech support is expensive from scansoft and none of their software that i have used have been easy to learn using the manuals or help files . in contrast omniform was well worth the money . omniform 5 does a great job of either creating forms from scratch , scanning or converting from pdf . it 's the only forms program i have tried so far that actually does a great job of importing a form from a pdf file . its has all the tools you need to create a form starting with a blank page . you can define any field with a variety of formats . example you can create a date field with a specific format then no matter how the data is input the program will automatically reformat the data the way you specified . you can create just about any field simply by dragging a symbol from a menu onto the page . in the case of inserting a graphic you can choose to have the graphic saved with the form or not saving with the form itself to conserve file size . you can have the graphic resized by the program with little loss of quality . features such as these might be available in other programs of this type but i found omniform to do the best job with creating a form field by field with the least effort . scanning in of a form is almost flawless . it even recognized fields on the paper form that were meant to be circled and created the field for them . other programs i have used could not do this well if at all . the only adjustments i had to make on scanned forms were sometimes omniform recognized text as bold when it was n't and occasionally it would change the font . for example it would change arial to times new roman on some spots of the form . strange quirk . to get a form imported from a pdf file you have to open the pdf file and print to omniform . this is very accurate with little adjustment necessary after import . omniform really shines in this area . but i did notice if the form your importing from pdf has multiple pages omniform will give you an out of memory error when you try to save . to overcome this flaw you have to import one page at a time , creating a new page each time in omniform to make a multi page form from pdf . a little time consuming when you have a 9 page form . it will create a self running .exe form you can e-mail and the person on the other end can fill out the form and send it back . this works even the other person does not have omniform on their machine . because some people filter out .exe file attachments the program also creates a .html version of the form . this is a very handy feature . the help file is not of much use . the paper manual is better but still lacking . if you have problems tech support from scansoft is expensive . but there is a user support forum you can get to through the support page on the scansoft web site . i have used the forum with great success . overall this program is a little difficult to use with some quirks and needed features like being able to import and save a multiple page form from pdf . but well worth the effort to use as it is the most accurate forms program i have used . i do recommend this program . if the flaws i mentioned were corrected i would give this program 5 stars
412,i started with a d50 and have loved it from the very begining . i felt ready to step up to the next level , but did n't think i was ready for the d200. when i heard about the d80 , i read everything i could . the biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body . i do n't use all of the mode setting and find myself in shutter and aperture priority most of the time , but it 's nice to have the others there when i do n't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings . the in camera image enhancements are amazing- -but a word of caution . vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots- -if not too much so . i 've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years . compared to the canon 30d ( which i was thinking about ) or even the new 400d ( i have n't actually held one yet ) , this is the nikon to have . on batter life , i had a recent shoot where i took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period . the battery was at about half and that 's with quite a bit of lcd viewing . at this level both canon and nikon offer great equipment- -you ca n't go wrong with either . just get one of each in your hands , snap a few shots , and go with the one that feels the best for you
413,this dvd of the wiggles is my 21 / 2 year old grandsons favorite . he watches it every day and never tires of it . i enjoy watching it with him . the wiggles are great entertainment for people of all ages . i do n't think you can go wrong with the wiggles
414,i personally like this compilation of prince , it 's got most of the songs i like and the sound is great . sure , there could have been a few more songs included , like " pop life " , " hot thing " , but when compared to the other compilations , this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have , for me , such as " i wanna be your lover " , which i do n't think was included on any of the other compilations . so , it 's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want , so that 's why i chose this disc and i 'm glad i did !
415,i bought this as a trial product , because the other stuff that i bought did n't work as what they advertise it . but this dusters picks up the dust instead of pushing to another place . this refills is quite cheap and it make my cleaning job much easier
416,2nd time .
417,after looking at the other reviews , i was a bit puzzled . i have n't had any of the problems other folks mention . pdf converter professional 4 does n't do everything that programs costing five times as much money . but , who cares ? background colors in a business form ? why ? ? ? ? do n't buy a camry and say " gee.. . i liked my lexus better . " most of you are going to buy this program to do one - or both - of these two things : 1 ) convert pdf documents into completely editable word docs , excel worksheets , or one of dozens of other formats.. . 2 ) combine documents of various formats into a single pdf . picture a customer manual that consists of word , excel , solidworks , quicken , powerpoint and project documents . you want to put them all together in one document complete with table of contents , bookmarks and thumbnails . voila ! this is the proram for you ! and for these purposes , pdf 4 professional is superb . it is easy to use . we have several users , and not one has had to refer to a manual or on line support . to put pdf converter to the test , we recently scanned , then saved-as-a-pdf a crooked , not highly legible fax . we then converted it into a word document , and roughly 90% of it came through perfectly . amazing . highly recommended
418,i got this software from office max . which is on sale for $8 on last week . my 6 year old kid , start learning typing and he keep saying he want to type all the time . pros : settings are awesome . you can choose two types of keyboards you can choose your words per min speed and many other aspects you can choose 4 different musics or do not have any . you can choose the difficulty levels . games and encouraging things for kids . cons : still needs to find one . how does it matter about cartoon chars speaking to you , adult can also learn from this cd , just by skipping cartoon talk .
419,i read this book with an open mind . i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status . in a few cases , i think this criticism may be legitimate ; in other cases , not . so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community . ( note : i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust . i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things , there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities . all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction . ) i did n't find anything in this book to convince me of that . what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust , in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over , and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons , but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view . the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland . the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports ( " audits , " etc. ) to which the author refers . but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point . i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to " play the victim card , " and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author 's allegations . to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews , and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result . it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage , and to the extent that this book detracts from this , i think it is unfortunate
420,i have loved many of jodi picoult 's other books , but this one seemed too far-fetched . i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it . many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release
421,after spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions , i was still unable to install this on either of my pcs . they do n't want to admit it , but their ad for deduction pro kills the software install at 21% ( or 26% for the standard version ) . and no , their " font patch " , killing all startup services , upgrading the flash player , nor starting in safe mode did not resolve the problem . i 'm out the money on this and am switching to turbotax . h&r block has lost this customer .
422,this book covers everything you 'll need to know about making model scenery . that being said , the material presented may seem a little overwhelming and difficult to a novice , however , with some trial and error , you 'll eventually get it righ
423,i used to have an canon elura 70 , which was an excellent camcorder but the firewire transfer did n't work so i decided to replace it with the elura 100 only to find that canon had discontinued the elura line . i really wanted an elura for the improved video quality over the low-end zr models . so as a compromise i purchased the zr 850 which has a 1mp ccd , not a good as the elura ( 1.3mp ) but better than the other zr 's ( .640mp ) . the video quality was n't bad but the motor noise was so loud i could n't believe it . i returned the first one but the replacement was just as bad . this is n't a minor hum in the background i 'm talking about , its a full-on whine ! i also found the zr camera to be difficult to handle with my small-ish hands and the video stabilisation was a bit disappointing . luckily i could return both cameras without incurring a restocking fee and found a reconditioned elura 100 that is much more satisfactory . its a mystery to me how canon can produce two markedly different cameras ( quality wise ) in the same price range and opt to phase out the better one
424,as the editor of the learning spanish products reviews ( learningspanishproductsreviews ) site , one of my responsibilities is to review learning-spanish software products that are listed on amazon . i am also a native spanish speaker and a professional spanish instructor . rosetta stone spanish is a great learning spanish product for a child or pre-teenager that wants to learn spanish . this software features native speakers , real-life images , and a speech recognition feature . your child or pre-teenager will find that this software is lots of fun . but the photographs do appear to be from at least two decades ago . i 'd actually give this product 5 stars as a tool for teaching a child or pre-teenager spanish . but as a learning-spanish product for an adult the effectiveness of the product really depends on whether the adult is a visual learner or not . my advice is for you to also experiment with some of the auditory or auditory / text based comprehensive spanish courses sold on amazon , and decide if you are primarily a visual or auditory ( or auditory / text ) learner . even if you determine that you learn better with or an auditory spanish course you can still get good results with rosetta stone spanish , by using it to complement your main auditory home-study spanish course . you may also find the rosetta stone software helpful if you 're an adult that has one or more of the major comprehensive auditory courses under your belt , and now you are merely seeking to expand your vocabulary .
425,at church today i came upon a man who had partially collapsed . since i 'm a physician , i stopped and offered aid . it turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was having some pretty concerning symptoms . to my dismay , we do not have an aed at our church ( yet ) . we notified 911 , and he was taken for medical care without any problems , but i was a bit worried there for a few minutes . while i 'm trained in bls , that is , at best , a temporizing measure . aeds have a proven ability to diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms . in my opinion , places of public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices . i 'll be working with our church to see if we can get one . i would have been a bit more relaxed waiting for ems if i had had one of these today . however , buying an aed is not a cure-all . i have been trained on these , and they are very simple to learn to use . however , i think it would be quite difficult for someone who had never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac arrest . if you are considering buying an aed for home or public use , i strongly suggest reading the section on aeds at the american heart association website . it discusses some of the important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a device . so , while not for everyone , this is one of the few products available that can truly save lives . in the right situation , it is indispensable .
426,this album is one of the only live albums that i do n't have . i have heard samples , and a few extra songs on other cds though . the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie could n't have been more high . his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group ( specifically reese wynans ) . most poeple do n't know this but , on the old vinyl copy of this album , ( i 've never heard it but someone told me ) there was originally a 14th track . it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie 's sets . the song was life without you . since it was the very last song , i 'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything . being high is one thing , but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible . in the old vinyl disc , stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted . this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness
427,it 's a pretty convinient bag.i put a canon rebel xt with a tamron 28-75 lens , a canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and i still have the small pocket for wallet , keys etc. the only drawback of this bag is , you can not put in big lenses.the canon 70-300 is the limit.but if you only have a limited gear collection , you need to give it a try
428,i have been waiting to see this film for a while now . and i just finally saw it i 'm very dissapointed . this was nothing but a low budget horror flick with cheap trills . the film sucks ! ! ! the nazi zombies coming back from there watery graves to terrorize modern day tourist that are in a small boat . and get stranded on a deserted isolated island . was a great ! idea except that with this film you 're going to be very bored and dissapointed if you ask me . i was expecting a lot more than this the zombie nazi 's make up looks silly . they 're not even frightning or scary they just made me laugh . the picture quality has aged even if it 's dvd format very grainy poor picture quality . i have seen other movies from the 1970 's on dvd and the picture quality looks excellent almost like new or like it has been digitally remasterd for it 's age . but this was awful . the only good thing it has was decent acting lol . like i said before this is nothing but a ( low budget cheap horror film ) rent it if you like . but dont purchased it it will be a waste of your money and time .
429,i think pauly shore is much more talented then people give him credit for . it is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films . but the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made . frankly i dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career , i think he probably knows that he is a living joke , i feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and i 'd say hes done that
430,does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures ! after buying this book - i was very disappointed since i thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks , rather it just shows displays of women 's faces . you will waste your money on purchasing this book
431,these cameras are as simple to use as any i have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much . great buy
432,did we need a gore vidal reader ? the author is something of a long-winded blowhard , commenting at length ( and i mean length ) on every topic imaginable . in that respect he is america 's voltaire , creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics , the arts , and religion and morals . it 's hard to say where vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism , as he is not a conventional leftist . because of his iconoclasm , this collection can only inform the reader about gore vidal , not his times nor any intellectual or political movement . all that said , vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit . this book is much too much for the casual reader - - stick to one of his many shorter collections instead - - but for a vidal fan ( or , say , a reader of & quot ; the nation&quot ; ) this book is worth the time commitment
433,i 've had this straightener for about 3 months - i loved it at first but now it 's a love / hate relationship . the " gold " plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use . the effect , my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff ! to make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates . i gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair , something that is hard to do ! this is the second store brand straightener i 've purchased with poor results . save your $$$ and buy a professional model from a hairdresser - it 's cheaper in the long run
434,i look at the average raiting for this movie . # stars , now thats supposed to mean its ok . well ppl , this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves . i read some review saying the musicwas good , and , well , from my perspective it seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments . like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment , and i would almost barely knotice , if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense . it was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here . save your money . i bought this after seeing the first , which was lame , but i though it was ok , and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something . well this was in 6th grade . huge mistake i hated it when i first saw it . it seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it . and about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play . good , considering its live , but lame as far as movies get . oh , and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil , just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing . i really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made . but that was untill i saw reptillian . which is kinda depressingly awfull
435,i 'll make this short and sweet - this is by far the best bond movie of them all , imho . excellent work by connery and the rest of the cast
436,i have enjoyed many of mark 's novels ( do you know that i love you is my favorite of the bunch ) , all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer . every character in every roeder novel speaks with the same voice- -all of them , and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters , his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older . there is frequent repetition and redudancy ; characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times ( though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel ancient prejudice , which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide ) . his characters always ( and i mean always ) mate for life , which is a beautiful romantic ideal , but ultimately can get tiresome ( gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment ) . all that said , at his best ( dykwik , a better life , keeper of secrets ) mark roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story . but in outfield menace , the bad most definitely outweighs the good . did mr. roeder do any research into the time period ? ? ? the fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel ( if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens , who do n't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time ) , but if you want to set a novel in the fifties , do n't have a lead male character with a ponytail . no one , but no one , wore a pony tail in the fifties ( and certainly not in a small midwest town ) . do n't have characters use anachronisms like " fifteen minutes of fame . " and most of all , do n't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys . mark roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing . he has apparently made a name for himself ( and some money i 'd guess ) , and i must confess , i 've bought his novels ( glutton for coming out stories that i am ) but no legitimate house would publish his novels , at least not without major editing and rewriting , something that a self published author ( especially one with an apparently inflated self image ) goes without . there has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two . major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as totally joe , m or f ? , the hookup artist , rainbow road , boy girl boy . read them , if only to see how these truly outstanding ( and published by legit houses ) novels could teach mark roeder a thing or two . if you must read roeder , then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep . memo to roeder : if you want to write about a time you do n't know about , do your research
437,this is a great book to have in your collection if you 're a fan of blues music and history . by far , it 's not the only book out there . there are a number of notable artists this book is missing . hopefully , future editions of this book will begin to fill some of the gaps . that being said , this is a very good reference just the same
438,sorry , this guy 's voice gave me the creeps . he sounds like a preacher . who can meditate without the ability to respond positively to the leading voice
439,this lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality . it compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk . might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul .
440,nowhere else in this country can you get this quality , accuracy and convenience at this price . fda approved and ncep certified , and the entire cholesterol panel.. . no other at-home test can make those claims . as for my results , they agreed perfectly with the lab test at my doctor 's office . why would anyone want to waste time at their doctor 's office when amazon.com makes this superb biosafe test available to any customer . i 'm recommending it to all my friends . buy one today ! or better yet 2 ; get one for a friend
441,from what i gather , edward abbey has somewhat of a cult following . i had never read anything by the guy , never even heard of him before i got this book . i just thought i should point that out before going on . this book kept me reading , no doubt about that . it has it 's downsides , but overall , i 'd reccomend it . not " hey , you gotta read this right now , " but it 's good if you 're looking for something a little different . this book kind of made me think . i 'm not the kind of guy who is always reading into a book trying to analyze every aspect of it . but i could n't help it with this story . i thought a lot of it was psychological , dealing with the main character , his thoughts , attitudes , and what made him tick . this is a fairly long book , but the actual story of the guy going back to his hometown is short . the plot alternates every chapter- - one about where he presently is , and then a memory , then where he is , then another memory , and so on . although it was an interesting way to write the book , i thought some of the memory sequences dragged a bit . but do n't get me wrong , overall i did enjoy them . if you 're looking for something that might be able to fuel a couple of thoughts about life , this is a good bookt to pick up
442,bill , when will you just die ? if you read this feel free to email me evan.fett@gmail.co
443,eos-1d mark ii digital this camera i use two months a little hard to use because it has a lot of things . i am not a proffecianal but i liked very much the pictures is the best like any camera i had .
444,i like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it , rather than having to use one or the other
445,i saw the tv show made , so i wanted to check out the full story . it was a disappointment , but my wife loved it . so there you are one against , one for it
446,i absolutely love this stuff . i would recommend this to any person that has frizz . it makes my hair feel so silky smoothe . i started using it about 2 months ago and cannot stand to go without it . just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and do n't put it close to the scalp either for the same reason . i tried the chi silk infusion because i thought they would be the same since they are both made by farouk but the chi is not nearly as good . i would give this 100 stars i could .
447,this review refers to " excalibur " ( dvd-region 2 ) in days of old , with knights so bold , and fair maidens glittering all in gold , lays the legend of king arthur , camelot , and the powerful , mystical sword known as " excalibur " . john boorman 's beautiful artistic film ( adopted from sir arthur mallory 's " le morte d'arthur " ) , will captivate you and take you away to another time and place . from the birth of arthur , merlin taking him away for 20 years , arthur drawing " excalibur " from the stone , the emergence of camelot , the magical powers of merlin and the evil morgana , to arthur 's demise and being taken off to avalon , the beauty of this film and this story will have you under a spell . the european cast and the exquisite location shoots in the country side of ireland add a sense of authenticity to the flavor of this film . king arthur , the knights of the round table , sir lancelot , guinevere , merlin , morgana , sir gawain , percival , uther , they 're all very much part of the story , and the cast is tremendous . nigel terry is the good and noble king arthur , lancelot and guinevere , who loved their king but also each other are played by nicholas clay and cherie lunghi . you 'll see stellar performances by a young gabriel bryne ( in his first feature film ) , patrick stewart , and liam neeson . helen mirren is excellent as the evil morgana , and the always wonderful nicol williamson is the magical mystical merlin this edition is for viewers with dvd players compatible with region 2 ( japan , europe , south africa , and the middle east , including egypt ) .some players are multi-regional , so check your manual . parents...although a wonderful tale of knights and fair ladies , this is not one for younger viewers . the battle scenes are violent and a bit graphic and there are also some sexual situations . " first knight " with richard gere and sean connery , although not quite as true to the legend , is rated pg-13 , is quite an entertaining film , and may be more suitable for family viewing ( there is some violence ) . a beautiful story and film . enjoy....lauri
448,to be or not to be is a comedy set during wwii . although it makes light of a tense time in history , it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease . the story revolves around two actors in poland , maria and joseph tura . joseph ( jack benny ) specializes in overplaying hamlet and maria ( carole lombard ) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his " to be or not to be " speech . the man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation . although she is working for the allies , a nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause . madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess . the film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting . it is a real shame that carole lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash ; she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne .
449,i did a little research after trying to install this product and found that symantec is no longer rated very well for anti virus . one site that states this is consumer reports ( they are towards the bottom of the ratings ) . it has become major bloatware and its stability is n't what it used to be . maybe this is why peter norton sold his interests and bailed out . i am far from being a novice , but this thing gave me a fight the whole way . so on with my saga . first , this product was supposed to be for windows xp and 2000 pro . even the box says this . but when i insert the cd in a w2k pro machine all i got was an error box showing the error icon and the ok button . real informative . going through the back door i try to install without going through the cd autostart program . now i get a box that says it requires xp 32 bit . so that leaves out 2 of the machines i bought this for . so i go to a machine running xp . first one loads ok , but it says it is incompatible with my firewall ( zonealarm ) which i happen to trust a lot . then on the second machine it goes through the install ( which takes 45 min ) and then runs the autoupdate and hangs halfway through . i finally had to abort it after it sat there an hour ( i was hoping it was just another slow moment ) . rebooted and the program was no longer running . starting it up myself resulted in it failing to load . now i 'm stuck , it wo n't allow me to uninstall nor reload it again . had to obtain a removal tool from their web site and it promptly removed every symantec product on the machine . maybe this was the writing on the wall ? by now i 'm a couple days into the drama . meanwhile , the first xp machine that loaded fine did another automatic update and guess what . it locked up half way through . now it will not run and had to be removed the same way . so i am now the proud owner of zonealarm 's internet suite . it cost less than the nav ( both 5 user versions ) , and loaded much faster . ten minutes and i was done , where it was an hour into nav when things worked and it loaded . i am taking this up with symantec and trying to get a refund . they can keep it . i 've been less satisfied with every upgrade and this one finally broke the camel 's back . maybe i 'll try again someday if i come up with a new camel , but they do n't grow well in seattle . added 3-12-2007 : i have also noted that after removing nav that things i could not explain before have been cured . for instance , the web site [...] would not load many of it 's pages correctly , they would show the text coding instead of html . now that i am nav free , all of the pages on this site load with no problems . hmmmm. .
450,let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy . after reading this book , i now think he is one step above slime . to be fair , some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing . he is anti-pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o'donnell , michael moore , barney frank , barbara streisand , and " that fat girl from the dixie chicks " , among others . no problem there in my opinion . that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book . the rest is just babble , often repeated over and over again , that even larry lovers will find annoying . a couple things that really bothered me . the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of " retards " and down 's syndrome children . he must use the term " retard " at least fifty+ times in the book . this is appreciably different than making a joke about , say , michael moore . moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes . the down 's syndrome children did not . my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on " retards " . he also racially sterotypes in the book . many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond . the down 's syndrome kids can't . larry , i can only hope god ( in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book ) grants you a " retard " child to love and care for . then , i would like to read your next book . i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly . the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses . he plays the good ' ol bubba . he ai n't too bright and he ai n't ever changed since he left the farm . his " celebrity " - his word not mine - has not gone to his head . ok , larry . why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures , including serious topics such as abortion ? why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down ? why the unrelenting references to your " celebrity " ? the terms " meet and greet " and " after-party " were used over and over and over , as an example . do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are ? well , you are wrong . they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become . that 's hollywood-speak my country , fart loving , nose picking friend . overall , this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron ( see does n't that sound better than " retard " ) . my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people . those who are dumb and know they are dumb . and those who are dumb but are so dumb , they do n't realize it . the former category usually shuts up ( knowing they are dumb ) . the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter . the first group is obviously smarter than the second . larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group . the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book . make jokes , larry , and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like . unfortunately , larry ca n't see the obvious . like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book , he has become exactly one of them . a thin layer of " good ' ol boy " on top , covering a core of venom and " celebrity " . he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets . my suggestion : do n't buy larry 's act and , by all means , do n't buy the book .
451,this product just does n't cut my nose hair as close as the panasonic it replaced . if i could remember the model of the panasonic , i would mention it in this review . i hope i can find the manual for the panasonic so i can get another one . beware that many of the new designs are going this rout ( even panasonic ) . the manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration , but i think its more of a liability issue on their part ( someone probably got sued for a nicked nose ) . i just wo n't buy their products anymore if they 're going to design them for marginal performance
452,i wore out my tape of cypress . afoot is great , but cypress is amazing . i bought this while stationed in the army . there were n't too many " new wave " tapes available at the px , and i was n't going to listen to def leppard or bon jovi . so i bought cypress . one of those rare tapes that i bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months ( the jam 's snap and setting sons , and the smith 's hatful of hollow are 3 other tapes i never tired of ) . get this cd . get it now ! it is great . thanks for reissuing it .
453,this is a fine collection for those who have recently discovered early rem as well as those who own rem 's previous irs years video collection : succumbs . the succumbs videos are all here , with some variation , and the additional videos / footage are excellent . very serious fans will want more , but this is better than nothing and worth the price . if you like early rem then you may like : 1 ) end of the day by reivers 2 ) banjos and sunshine by sixty acres 3 ) a life full of farewells by the apartments 4 ) massachusetts by scud mountain boys
454,this book is more of an advertisement for scoblete 's other books , his writing buddies other books , and his golden touch craps siminar . this book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control , which is the reason i bought this book . the book is rather a collection of stories . scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps . it would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up , especially the captain , the authors ultimate craps hero . i could n't even finish this book . it was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through , and left the reader with no knowledge gained . if you are interested in a good casino book i recomend something by avery cardoza or a book published by his company
455,i love cinderella and try to see them live whenever they 're in town , but the sound on this dvd is just horrible . did n't anyone listen to it before releasing it ? the video quality is fair . they sure did n't spend a lot of money on production here . i was very disappointed and wish i could get my money back
456,having had perfectly clear skin through my teens , 20s , and most of my 30s , i now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. my skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most otc acne products . i bought this product out of desperation , not believing it would work . after reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks , i have found that it works well , with some modifications . my experience : cystic acne goes through its normal cycle ( rising to surface , becoming a hideous scab , etc. ) in a fraction of the normal time ( 4 days versus 4 weeks ) when treated as directed with zeno , or it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface ( after a week or so ) , when treated very aggressively with zeno . my advice : do n't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised . do know that with diligence and patience , it will work . be very aggressive . do double-cycles ( allow the zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps , then press the button for a second cycle ) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way . you may get very slight burning of your skin ( causing a whitish film or slight peeling ) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it 's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne . i am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition , and seeing the results i have hoped for after 2 weeks
457,i got tiger to improve the working of my powerbook g4 1.5. my jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer . before tiger , my computer would hang when playing large dv files ( such as the ones i made in imovie ) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same . this tiger upgrade does n't include some of the apps ( games , quicken , etc. ) that my wife has on her new macbook , but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iworks which has come in handy
458,i have tried other systems before and they took the " long way around " about getting to the rock and roll stuff i wanted . this one however jumps straight into what i wanted to know about rock guitar . the teaching method is fantastic . the program shows not only where notes would fall but includes a " virtual fret board " so i can see exactly what to play . this feature includes a " slow " version to start with then a normal speed version that ( in almost every case ) is exactly like the song being heard . i have played guitar ( that is fooled with guitar ) for about twenty years this program got me playing and learning every day for a couple hours . now i have much more fun jamming and playing songs i have heard . i recommend this for anyone beginners to intermediate
459,i was a private beta tester for the new os . i tested the software for a whole year and i am not pleased with it . if you depend on stability for your existing software , you are out of luck . the hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible . many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use windows vista . you are better off upgrading to a mac . after all , microsoft did steal many ideas from apple computers .
460,my hair is very wavy and frizzy , i have to condition my hair every day so it does n't look dry and damaged . 2 weeks ago i got my hair cut , the stylist used a sedu straightener on me . wow ! suddenly , my hair was stick straight and super glossy ( really brought out the natural highlights ) . i bought one from him for $199 ( should have checked the internet first ) . i 've tried a cheap flat iron before ; after wrestling with it for 40 minutes and pulling the heck out of my hair , all i got was slightly " pressed " hair . the sedu iron has super smooth ionic plates , so it glides through your hair very easily , quickly and smoothly . no more pulling of my hair . i can give myself smooth , gorgeous , in about 5 minutes . another plus is that the style will stay until the next time you wash your hair ; now i only have to straighten my hair every other day . sure , sedu is on the expensive side , but this salon-quality tool is more than worth it . look good and feel good every day !
461,there have been enough changes for the better to make this product well worth the purchase , installation , & learning curve
462,wow ! what more can i say ! just watching this was an absolutely extraordinary experience . this is a " behind the scenes " look at photography . it gets you up close and personal with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in trying to capture the " shot of a lifetime " . i own many national geographic books , but you wo n't be able to appreciate what goes into each photograph without watching this dvd . even those who are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate it
463,i have n't actually used the bottles sent to me as of yet but used this product all last summer . i love the fact that the blue lizard suncream stays on so well . my kids can swim and stay at the beach for hours and blue lizard does the trick ! ! ! i do n't think they got burnt one time last year while i was using this . great product ! !
464,is anyone else having issues with these discs ? when you first place the discs in the player , it skips over the main menus . then the " menu " button will only start and stop the episode selected , but it will not return you to the main menu . there is no spanish or portuguese dubbed audio on the discs ( despite what the menus and packaging claim ) and the episodes automatically play with spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned " off . " the only way to avoid this is to choose " other " subtitles with the remote . this appears to be an authoring issue , as i am using a two year-old sony dream system dvd player and have not had these issues with previous seasons . i 'm exchanging my discs immediately , but i have a feeling they might all be bad . anyone else hear about these issues
465,this was 2pac 's last good album before he joined deathrow.he was a good rapper but never the best , he started too much beef with other rappers for no reason.he had alot of beef with east coast rappers like biggie , nas , jay-z and mobb deep , but he never opened his mouth about wu-tang because they would lyrically destroy him.this is one of the best albums from 95 right behind gza 's liquid swords and mobb deep 's the infamous
466,this pedometer is so much cheaper ( ~$7 ) than the typical decent ones ( that go for about $18 - $20 ) .. now i know it is for a reason. . the buttons are flimsy , the package looks very cheap , the one i bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work , also found that the sr citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device. . terrible ergonomics / form factor . would recommend spending a bit more and getting the omron / oregon sc $18 pedometers - much better form factor , high reliability and quality
467,i had the exact same experience as another reviewer . ....loved it for years...changed formats...no confidence . at the last minute i had to use an accountant . the accountant cost me $650.00. $50 more than what i was over paying in taxes using this software . a disaster . it does n't look like it was importing data correctly , state navigation really was painful . i buy this software to try different senerios ( joint or single ) ...but this year it would n't do that . probably because they worry too much about getting paid for every user and not enough to assist people who bought the software . to my mind the software is crippled
468,this minnesota-filmed movie reportedly has a cult-following , and the reason is not far to realize . joe mazzello . joe is a 1990s and 21st century motion-picture phenomenon . his presence in this movie is so realistic and life-life that you forget that he is acting . he was pivotal in carrying this movie . how so ? may i add that joe 's axiom for acting is simply : " just make it look real ! " he achieved this to a stellar degree in " the cure , " and also in the later fare : " simon birch " . incredible acting , and i know good acting , for i was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical score for it . no , i am not going to name-drop . the cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social / geographical / educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly forged and may i add that it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern , honest caring , and warm affection . no matter how many times i watch it , tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film . joe is the best !
469,terms of endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by shirley maclaine and debra winger . it covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom aurora and daughter emma . they have their differences ; yet the love between them is always so obvious . it 's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other , even their sex lives . i 've seen this movie several times , and everytime i cry at the end . in spite of the death , the movie ends on a positive note , giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay . the budding relationship between aurora and her neighbor ( also brilliantly portrayed by jack nicholson ) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between emma and her husband and children . the most interesting aspect is that emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her , when she has been cheating on him as well . somehow though we sympathize with emma and her gentle lover ( played by the very talented john lithgow ) . we feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship does n't seem wrong . if you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time , this is a perfect choice
470,first of all , the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles . there are far fewer images than the number touted . this is a scam in my opinion , but a situation i could live with . but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor , actually totally unusable resolution . they have corrupted clarity , poor pixel quality , are distorted , and unsuitable except for perhaps , a third grader 's school project . it was a complete waste of money . it is headed for the first garage sale i hold , and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy .
471,looks nice . unfortunately did not power up the camera , so i ca n't say much else . going to cost me return shipping at the very least . sorry i did n't buy the canon product instead
472,i love this turban . it enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head . it 's lightweight and extremely absorbant . i have been using one for more than 5 years . i 'll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair
473,contrary to purported performance claims , my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of duracell 's products . decades of experience with everready energizers - and with other duracell products ( e.g. , coppertops ) - show procell products to be markedly inferior in performance . regardless of how long their shelf life may be , they simply have n't performed up to par , much less equally to other alkaline batteries . this has just been my experience - over daily use , over many months , with set after set of procell aa batteries . take it for what its ' worth
474,here is the short version . oct05 i bought a fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera for $299.99. nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating bright / dark horizonal strips across them . jan07 i sent the camera in to fujifilm 's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires . jan07 the service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 ( i spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if i accepted ) . feb07 i contacted the service center and stated that i think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse . and that i do n't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired . the service rep , named christina , asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do . i complied . mar07 fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that i did not reply to the estimate . now i will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera , its memory card , and the shipping i paid .
475,i really like this program . i have purchased three different bible programs for my pda and this one is by far the best of the three .
476,i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years . i love everything canon does . however i do not understand canon 's reasoning behind producing this lens . the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the " film " plane . they cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens . they have indicated , however , that by 35 mm that advantage is gone . why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses ? i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper ; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro . as i said , if for $60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach ( 66 in 1.6crop cameras ; useful in macro photography ) and that works on all canon cameras , i 'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all . granted , you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon , but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr 's , so why bother with this lens ? the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup , but the 60mm macro does n't make any sense to me . my $0.0
477,painstakingly compiled by judy brown ( contributing writer and comedy critic for la weekley ) , the funny pages is an impressive and hilarious collection of 1 , 473 jokes gathered from the funniest modern-day comedians around , ranging from robin williams to bill cosby , george burns , conan o'brien , and many , many more . the individual jokes are arranged by topic underneath dictionary-style headings . from alcohol to yoga and zoos ; each gag is short but sweet , and packs a punch in this chuckle-inducing , highly recommended anthology of wit , gags , and humor both classic and cutting edge
478,i really like the crane humidifiers for children , my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time . it occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet . so i was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good . i was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than i had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different . still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it did n't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off . this may be a fault with the one i received and so i have sent it back , or it may be a design flaw with this shape . i have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere . so although i have n't had chance to use it i am more hopeful of success . it is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them , i forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time
479,i am very disappointed with this product . using the features of it are very difficult ( red eye , sizing , etc. ) in addition , digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality / clarity on the computer screen . i expected more from it but have found i have less . i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features
480,this machine bubbles but they are anything but quiet . the water was cold in less than 2 minutes even though i put hot water in has per the instructions . a bucket would probally have done better along with air pump from my fish tank
481,perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in english ( or at least it appears to have been , there is no translator listed ) , but this is by far the most lucid thing i 've read by latour . in a way it 's a radical break , he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child actor network theory , stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work .
482,great product ! i have had a little experience with frontpage , but this product is definitely not frontpage with a new look . this is an easy to use yet professionally powerful tool for web page development . it goes way beyond my abilities . if microsoft continues to develop this product the way it has started....then watch out dreamweaver
483,while this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot , the mistakes are inexcusable . many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data . therefore , one begins to lose trust in the information presented . be careful if you use this book
484,this album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today , this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2. right before female rappers ( there 's a few exceptions ) , i hate all little kid rappers . even when i was a kid . i do n't like anything on this album , i still got the tape and it has n't " krossed " my mind to even cop the cd . if you like this kind of stuff , or you loved " jump " back in the day then i guess this is for you
485,i enjoyed this book immensely . remember , the subtitle is " my friendship with jfk , jr. " , the book is about the author and his friendship with john . it 's not meant to be a historical view of jfk and his presidency . why is it ok for carole radiwill to write a book about her relationship with jfk , jr. and carolyn but not ok for billy noonan ? because he was n't on oprah . lighten up .
486,i am a female bowhunter who really had trouble judjing distances on green fields . this is a great product . it is easy to use and very accurate
487,well presented , easy to follow along , and easy to revisit previous lessons . videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played . not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students . some of the accompanyment / singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along . some of the material / songs may not be to everyones liking , but again , these are okay for the beginner . the singing can be a slight destraction sometimes . i probably would n't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar....and i do n't think most people buying it would think it 's all the will every need to become a great guitar player . i 'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique . i 'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful . bottom line ; this is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar .
488,these bars arrive smashed , melting and stale..taste like cardboard with , dried blueberrie jam spread around on them...awfu
489,i do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment . but i simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it . this is called censorship , and it gives me the creeps . as a parent , i have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children . so to realise that somebody has been cheating on me , trying to do my job so that i did not have to explain how society has evolved , how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud . this review is about the harper collins edition , edited by patricia c . and frederick l . mckissak , illustrated by michael hague
490,stay tuned is about roy and helen knable . roy gets a new tv from mr. spike . the new tv has 666 channels that 's filled with shows such as " facts of life support " , " 30 something to life " , " sadistic hidden videoes " , " murder , she likes " and commerical parodies . roy and helen has 24 hours to live through hell 's channels . will they make it out alive ? stay tuned
491,so far we have been unable to use this product in the way we want to use it . we contacted tech support , but after one call , we will be charged $19.95 for each call . i have been disappointed in the product and the company
492,now i know what you 're thinking , why are there two releases of " xx " ? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re-released the album " xx " but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals ( big mistake ! ) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001. if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !
493,i 've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years , both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation , and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed
494,just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test . i was very pleased with the results . this is a powerful lens , yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use . i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds , zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) and virtually every shot was a keeper . the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus . usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one . i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i did n't see any problems with focus , clarity or sharpness . all the images were clean and razor sharp . if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment , i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal .
495,these guys are not artists . they are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene . it 's like a few monkeys build a house , and all the other monkeys rave about it , but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat.. . whatever that means . i am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio . buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere .
496,love the idea for these books - perry mason - nancy drew - ca n't wait for the next one . love the research that gets sprinkled in to make a fun book . who 's next mike hammer - philip marlowe ? ?
497,do not waste your money ! i consider myself pretty computer savvy , but this software is not easy to use . you 'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand .
498,oh , this is pure adult garbage all right . i have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this , then again the movie was garbage also
499,hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd . i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance , even better than tuckwell's . the cadenzas are absolutely awesome . i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well . clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy . i 'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician . highly recommended
500,plain and simple i 'm 32 years old and been dianosed with hbp since 15 years old . i 'm on three medication for hbp . i order this then i wait for it to come . i jjust happen to go to the doctor today , he takes my pressure and tells me its 113 / 100. when i arrive home one hour later , the device is waiting for me . i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is 101 / 75. sending the unit back
501,a great new interface including control layout , easier than ever to use , and complete . there is no other product in this class . it looks great in xp and even sharper in vista . subject to some agreement with adbobe , you 'll have to download the free pdf writer from microsoft ( the beta came with it ) , but it works exactly the same and otherwise no suprises . the product is pricey and you may want to purchase a smaller release ( less applications in the suite ) depending on your needs
502,if you 're a fan of latin music and especially spanish guitar , you will love cafe tropical . every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar , to piano , violin , trumpet , and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments . every time i put this cd on i hear new things , which i find makes for an even more enjoyable listen . as usual , johannes linstead delivers some of the most catchy and memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre , and of course his guitar playing speaks for itself . highly recommended
503,this is the 3 copy version of norton av . ( one cd will create three copies ) i purchased it to save money as it was less than $20 per copy . i bought it to replace nav 2006 on the same three computers which had expired . installed easily on two machines . just the uninstall of 2006 and the install of 2007. the first machine was more difficult . there is evidently some conflicting software on the computer as i had to use msconfig for a " clean boot " per norton web site instructions . i kept running into the " blue screen of death " on the previous installs when i would get to the actual install of the norton av . each time i would have to uninstall the program and do more . but all of the help came from the symantec ( norton ) website . it is now working fine . added : my personal preference is to not use software firewalls . i use a router with nat as a hardware firewall . ( it only blocks unauthorized incoming malware ) software firewalls try to tell you about everything leaving your computer and generally you either become paranoid or just shut the thing off . they are intended to look for malware by behavior . antivirus programs look for malware by signature . the only advantage to finding malware by behavior is if the computer is attacked in the first day or two of the malware 's existence . if one has an antivirus program it will eventually ( within a few days ) find the problem that the software firewall was trying to tell someone about . ( assuming they have n't given up yet with too many cries for wolf ) . so the only software firewall i have ( microsoft os firewall ) is turned off and thus i have n't had the same problem as others report . as a practice i sent junk email directly to the trash can and avoid weird websites . so far no problems with malware .
504,very speedy delivery . a gift for my daughter . she loves it . i thought we were to receive a free photo card but did not . not really necessary . did not know that . still playing with it and having a blast . i do like that it is weather resistant
505,i bought this as a present for my mother but tried it first to be sure it was worth the money . it really is ! after using this the recomended 15 minuets , my feet felt just like they did when i had a professional foot massage ! i highly recomend this for anyone who enjoys having thier feet massaged
506,quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time . clive owen is really cool , but not in this movie . angelina jolie 's polital agenda totally fueled this film . what a waste of time
507,my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles- -shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur
508,my major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires . these extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp , vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin , and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun . vampires are supposed to be scary , but how frightened of them should i be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him . writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable . the first underworld movie would be a good model .
509,this product was reffered to me by my hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair . this has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the blowdryer and straightening iron ! i would give this product 10 stars if it were available ! my hair is very smooth and very healthy looking because of this product and other products by chi . i absolutely recommend this to anyone
510,i do a lot of work out of town and in other states , so i am constantly in unfamiliar or different places . this gps has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its ' self in saved mileage that i used to spend looking for places . i have recommended it to everyone that i have talked to . it 's great , i will never have to mapquest or ask for directions again . another great microsoft product
511,i absolutely love this little book light . it is so slim and easy to store , plus i can use it for my magazines and paperbacks . i highly recommend this item . a++
512,this product was a bad choice for me . it was a poorly done product . it was washed out , the quality , both audio and video was terrible . it was not enjoyable to watch . the packaging was cheap quality . i should have known better . pay more and get a nice set , and a better product . do n't try and save a few dollars if you want something to enjoy . paper sleeves make for a cheap copy .
513,i bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back . i am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors . after hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here 's the lowdown.. . pros ... picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10x ( i never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures , although this camera is n't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom ) . prints that i 've made up to 16x20 " ( have n't gone larger , but i know i can ) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6. it is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick . the stabilization at full 10x zoom is incredible also . it appears really shaky through the window , but pictures continue to turn out crisp . close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details . the movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion ( read cons ) . cons ... indoor shooting is limited because the flash is n't strong enough . when at a school chorus concert , the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear . award ceremonies , the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards . the zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie . this camera seems to eat batteries , especially in the winter months . i am always on the go , and when i go to pull out the camera i find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again . it comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so i must always have lens cleaner wipes on me . the viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere , but that also is minor . most of the cons really are all minor things that do n't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues . i tried to be as precise about this camera as possible . all in all , i would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer . if you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities , just keep in mind for the flash to work good , keep your subjects close . it 's been bumped , jostled , and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem
514,it was a nice looking razor but it did n't work and i had to send it back for credit . i bought another one locally and had trouble with it also . i wonder if the 5200 just does n't have to many bells & whistles . i finally bought a 5100 it 's a plain jane but is working great
515,before you all dismiss me as an obsessive , close-minded thrash fanatic ; i thoroughly enjoyed " chaos ad , " which was a sep ' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal . i like the idea of experimenting with tribal sounds , but with those sounds , max decided to throw in downtuned guitars , not doing guitar solos , excessive profanity , lame " i hate this i hate that " lyrics , and guest musicians . the only decent songs on here are " roots bloody roots " and " dictators*** ; " everything else is awful . this is n't sepultura , this is soulfly . i 'm glad max left because if he stayed in the band , sep ' would have degenerated into a nu-metal band . for good sepultura albums , get these instead ( starting with the best ) : schizophrenia morbid visions / bestial devastation beneath the remains arise chaos ad dante xxi nation roorback ps , you max fanatics need to cut derik green some slack , he 's keeping sep ' alive while max is making an arse of himself with soulfly
516,this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13 , 000 years across the continents . diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume . the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali . yali 's question was , " why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea , but we black people had little cargo of our own ? " reading the book , i think i gulped at this point . this sounds like a classic , loaded question . it sounds disturbingly close to why have we ( europe and its former colonies ) succeeded where they have failed . diamond does not descend into that territory though , but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely . there are references to a culture 's success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing , for instance . the advantages of a hunting / gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia . this history can probably be described ( or perhaps is most successful ) as based around environmental causation ( as opposed to the racial / ethnic / social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing ) . descriptions of climate ( note : that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age ) , longitudinal or latitudinal axes , elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity . still , it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title . guns . europe 's refinement of this technology was based on china 's innovations with gunpowder . today 's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated . as an interesting counterpoint , japan had owned more and better guns in c . 1600 ce , than any country in the world . samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology . japan would n't resume manufacture until mid 19th century . obviously , there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry 's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today . germs . epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who did n't survive . smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities . epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals ( and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate ) . interesting note : the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease ( likely smallpox ) rather than guns . steel . technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities . a hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining , as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas . diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society , where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses . there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things . first , there appears to need to be sustainable farming . many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region ( where today we invade , suck oil , and force the conquered to endure freedom ) . the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop . as a complete side note , the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming . another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself . compared to africa and the americas , eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south . movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal . something like corn ( maize ) which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography . llamas and guinea pigs ( which could be useful for pack animals and food ) never made it north . conversely , all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle , horses , pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe . to answer yali 's question , some of the answer is luck . africa , australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had . some other is environmental determinism , where you are helps make up who you become . for going forward , diamond cites transportation , communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future . after word : harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up , but not as fully developed here , that of pre-clovis native american discoveries ( pronouncements ) , knowingly confronting a loaded racial / ethnocentric question in a folio called " might white of you : are american archaeologists white supremacists ? " the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about 9000-11000 bce . there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date , but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive . one wonders if the pre-clovis discovery ( especially all the business about " caucusoid " skulls ) , is n't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide .
517,i bought this after using the inexpensive wahls for years . i love it for several reasons : 1 ) it cuts without pulling on your whiskers 2 ) it is very precise 3 ) it picks up 90% or more of your whiskers 4 ) not only do you not have the hair in the sink , but you no longer feel like it will take a shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard , if there is any to speak of 5 ) unlike others , i did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache . it worked just fin
518,i have read almost all of the works in the past masters series . this is by far the worse . i do not ordinarily write about books i do not like . but this work truly deserves a bad word . it is not about shakespeare , but rather about germaine greer . she simply did not do the assignment that she was given
519,cruel , horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot . the abuse of children , evil ranger poising as a dead ranger , freaky religious sect , dead animals on the bed , and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me . i 've read many barr books , and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters , it 's hard to keep them straight . in this book , that was the last of my worries . i did n't even finish it , i was so turned off
520,i have been a long-time radiohead fan and , like many others , have been waiting patiently for a live dvd . so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist . it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old ! i could n't help being disappointed when i watched this dvd . the constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch . in fact , i only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust . i know i would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime . i 've always that radiohead was modern , progressive , and totally innovative . i appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey.. . and it does n't help that before every song , thom mutters " this is a new one . "
521,ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology , so she attacks without understanding . she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people 's work she denigrates . maslow 's hierarchy of needs is one example . i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings . i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers , and william coulson as instructors . any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them . she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book . her bias is extreme and obvious . so consider this when reading the book . no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs . i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology
522,i had the same problem with works suite 2002 that i had with 2006. the product key that came with the discs would not install microsoft word ; the message " invalid product key " came up . after a computer problem , i reformatted the drive and did a reinstall from the original works 2002 discs . the invalid key message showed up when i tried to install word 2002. after arguing with microsoft people for three weeks i bought the new works suite 2006. after running all the discs to a clean hard drive , everything worked except , again , the invalid key message came up and would n't activate word . highly irritating . i got it going by to microsoft works , programs , clicked word document , got an " activate product " and got word installed and running . this seems to be a dumb glitch in the software
523,not his best stuff . he 's running short of lyrical ideas , he recycles his own lines , like star wars recycles " i have a bad feeling about this " . beats are usually cool , i do n't care for the popish tracks with the singing . i did n't mind it so much when he sang really bad back on his first album , but now it 's no longer funny , it sounds like pop . anyhow , organized religion is crap . i thought krs understood this back in the day . what happened ? now he 's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy , and his only little diciples and crap , i dunno , it 's posative , but then again it 's gay like some of his modern tracks . anyhow it is cheap , if you have to finish off your collection as i do , then buy it , otherwise go buy his anything boombap on back . or check out : kool keith el-p gang starr mr. lif jedi miind tricks public enemy non phixion sir menelik most of which is better than krs ' latest works
524,its a good software , it works good and keep the computer safe from spam , virus , and some others malware , try it
525,i 've had this pc remove for 1 year and i have used it everyday that i am home and i have not yet changed the remote batteries . my pc has suddenly become more entertaining and useful . with this remote , the time i spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced . in my 860 sq ft apt , the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft . the remote has always worked from anywhere in the apt thru 2 walls . i was surprised to get this much range . i have not yet found a spot from which it does n't work . to get the best range be sure to position the usb rf receiver near the computer as directed . with my pc , i 'm always playing music . i also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the internet . i have a good graphics card with s-video tv out . i got a 50 ft s-video / out cable ; this connects my pc and tv which are in different rooms . with this remote , i now can play ( and control ) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo ( which is connected to the tv ) without being at my pc or be in the same room as my pc . also , with this remote , any video that can be played on my pc , ( online streaming or local ) i can watch and control it ( pause , rewind , slow motion , next , fwd ) on my tv . my pc / tv has effectively become a powerful media center- -media center pc not needed . there is so much more.. . with the remote , i use the mouse from far away ( lying in bed or on the couch ) ; there a numerous ways to get creative with this . i wish the remote was lighted . still , the keys are arranged for " touch typing " so to speak . another negative , i 've noticed that windows media player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote .
526,this is a fascinating read and my favorite of all bacon 's writings
527,the first x-men movie was fantastic . the second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better . this third movie was absolute trash and i will never buy it
528,this is the first is lens that i 've owned . i had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that i took the step up . keep in mind that tis is an ef not ef-s lens . this makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my digital rebel . i love the zoom range ( great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces ) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots . just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under " share your own customer images " . pete leclair http : / / www.agentz.com / digitalimagesbyjpl
529,i returned this item . i have not received notice that they did receive it back so i will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited
530,i 'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera , the aiptek zoom dv-6 mp image stabilizing camcorder w / 3x optical zoom . i see the claim that it has 3x optical zoom and cannot help but question this because i am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since july 30th , 2006. am wondering what gives with that ? please someone , post a review of this model and hopefully , some picture results too . let us know about this 3x optical zoom , please ! i had to pick a rating , so the four star rating was based on the mpvr version of this camera - - which i own and find to be a very decent gadget . mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model . mp3 's sound terrific . i convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and.. . " wow " for its quality . i have recorded sounds and more . very decent ! just drag and drop my files from my pc to the sd card and i can switch out movies and mp3's . i am happy with that model , but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital . still get pretty good pix tho , just use the various settings.. . my little homemade movies are good , very decent , but without additional lighting , indoor movies will be dark . this camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - i use an umbrella over my cam as i film . big diff . so , is this newer model really all that much better ? ca n't wait to know ! 3x optical sounds good. .
531,i received this product and have been using it for a couple of weeks . it is exactly as advertised . it is very easy to use and the software is extremely user friendly . i am amazed at the quality of the recordings . i would definately recommend this product
532,very happy with our camera ! perfect condition and quick arrival
533,i am a huge fan of elvis costello and ran to the shop as soon as i read the great reviews of this album , what a mistake ! ! ! very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version . the cardboard cut salsa montuno of ' clubland ' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful ska sound of ' watching the detectives ' is lost in a jazz arrangement that does n't offer much to the melody . elvis ' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of ' almost blue ' and most of the songs . it worked well on his ' juliet letters ' album because the brodsky quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the metropole orkest it is just painful . for me , ' hora decubitus ' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble
534,i have seen many pathetic films in my life . this topped them . did i rate one star ? sorry - i meant negative 11 stars . it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping . there was no point . the script and storyline were pathetic . the gore was overdone - too much blood , killing , and the like . it was totally historically inaccurate , and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable . all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves . any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic . one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar - yet he does not even load it - either time . and somehow , without even aiming the canon , he knocks his ' friend ' off his horse . the movie is a failure . f-a-i-l-u-r-e . crappy . junky . just plain dumb . stupid . pathetic . i am not going to waste any more words on it . just....whatever you do....save your money . do n't buy it . it 's not worth 50 cents
535,i found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what i want it to and i only paid $14.99 for it . it does n't cause my hair to frizz up and it 's easy to style when i take the rollers out . as far as it taking too long to heat up , i do n't really let that affect my review because i plug it in and while it is heating up i do my makeup or something else . ( i 'm a multi-tasker anyway ) i also do n't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair . overall i like it .
536,i 'm not a spider-man fan . i love powers , the ultimates , supreme power , planetary and other stuff by warren ellis , brian michael bendis , et.al . so when i bought this , i wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it . i wanted to read straczynski 's recent run of spider-man , but if i was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel , why not spend a little more for the whole thing . and that 's just what you get . in addition to getting straczynski 's 4-year run ( which includes spider-man 's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers ) , you get everything leading up to june 2006 ( which is just like 3 issues ago ! ) . and all on 1 dvd-rom . true , the cons are that when it comes to crossovers , you only get the amazing spider-man stories and reading it off your computer is n't as fun as reading the actual comics - - but that does n't compare to getting the entire run . it 's like complaining about getting a free ps3 , xbox360 and nintendo wii , because the box did n't come with it or you 're missing one controller . $50 may seem steep , but if comics cost $3 now , so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics - - or for 2 books , you get everything . and it 's true , you can just print out the pages if you want ( so if you want to abuse your office or school 's printer , go for it !
537,i have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one . the video tutorials are the greatest help of all . the home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want , but that is not the easiest task . i would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true
538,i purchased this camera for my own birthday present last october . i have owned it for 1 year and 2 months and now it is n't working . i paid $400.00 for it last year when it was " new . " the lcd will only turn on every 15 - 20 times after i take the batteries out and turn the camera on and off . i purchased new rechargeable batteries , but that was n't the answer . i contacted panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period . they will charge a flat $140.00 to fix it and i can get a new one for about $150.00. i loved this camera , but it is such a disappointment . i was very easy with it - it just stopped working ! buy a different camera - i wish i had
539,i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews . i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual . the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use . i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse . i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal . do not buy this product
540,i made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews . it replaces a six year old 2.1 megapixel camera . i am not disappointed . amazon 's price is very good for a 7.1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features . it is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera . later i read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality . they criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur ( especially at higher power zoom ) and " noise " at film speeds over 100 asa . i set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent . then i enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos . had i printed the full frame , the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10. i just do not see the problems the experts criticize . the colors are rich and vibrant . i really appreciate the wide range of controls . the user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations . these result in a faster shutter speed , or more depth of field , or fill-in flash , etc. it is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial . an on-screen prompt tells you what each mode does . i also like the amount of control in the manual mode . the user can choose the asa rating , shutter speed , apeture opening , and electronic flash mode . the manual tells how to set the camera for special situations , like photographing documents . when you take the picture , the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second . you know the picture has been taken , unlike a camera with an optical finder . the camera is very intuitive for first time use . i also read most of the manual on-line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store . when i first installed the software i restarted the computer , but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera . i switched to another usb cord and it worked fine immediately . then it also began to work with the original usb cord . i had even checked for a loose connection . who knows what that was about ! one little thing to keep in mind is this . if the camera is set on continuous auto focus , you can aim and shoot . if it is set on one-time auto focus , you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting , if you want sharp pictures . i do not know , but expect the difference is battery life . a 1 gb memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7.1 megapixel resolution
541,it 's a funny concept to begin with , and stiller is hilarious . then you throw in rip torn ( probably the best film judas , among his many credits over the years ) , and these cameos that are out of control ( shatner , armstrong , norris ) and you 've got a comic classic .
542,this product is great at exfoliating , not so great at hair removal . your skin will be silky smooth , but still have hair . the hair that is removed does n't stay gone long . and it 's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body . it will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product .
543,do n't be fooled by the similar-sounding , inarticulate reviews- -this product is not what you think it is . it contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation . the " energy fields " described have nothing to do with actual energy / electricity- -they might as well use the word " aura " for all of the logical sense it makes . in the words of a company representative : the tingler is not battery operated there is no button . that would be our sqwiggler which has 2 aa batteries located in the handle . you 're welcome to return the tingler for a sqwiggler . the sqwiggler is $29.95 please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $9.95 plus $8.45 for the shipping fees . make your own judgement , but do n't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you 'll be
544,and finding stories of stacks of old vinyls , dripping yesterday and glowing always . cali 's finest , madlib , is definitely one of the heirs of dj premiere , pete rock , dj quik and other previous beat konductas that helped established the sound of true hip-hop as a platform where old school soul and new school technique are amalgamated . the latest madlib invasion is not for everybody ; those of us who 's butts were undeniably moved by tribe 's " low end theory " will definitely appreciate this endeavor . those of you who are tired of what mtv and other corporate entities and pass off as hip hop , clean out your crazy uncle otis 's attic check out the beat konducta . then walk down the street to mr. yancey 's house , go into his basement and check out j dilla 's " donuts .
545,i purchased this book at walmart , which rarely carries books regarding shambala or any other eastern ideology . it was cheap and on the clearance rack . i should have know better . when i realized this was part three in a series i decided to read the first two books , the celestine prophecy and the tenth insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one . after borrowing and reading the first two , i realized what a sham this series truly is . first , i realize they are supposed to be fictional . however , when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise , the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate . additionally , when usurping a mythical name such as shambala , one should know what the actual mythology entails , instead of making up one 's own notion of what is involed . shambala is not the same as shangri-la . shangri-la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century western culture . shambala is an ancient eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in redfield 's imagination . also , beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies . as joseph campbell said many times in his lectures and books , they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures , but they must never be mixed together . it just does n't work
546,incredibly useful ! exactly what i need all in one place
547,we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n't know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the " regular " memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it 's not faster than my older p52. 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality
548,if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u.s. , as kurlansky attempts in this book , the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year . the reader is owed specifics , yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes . prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent , but prohibited it . chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government , however flawed , resulting from open debate . a bigger difference could hardly be imagined . but kurlansky does see striking differences , albeit only in the post-1968 world . the soviet bloc began it 's decent to oblivion , while the capitalist west avoided the same . his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean , though what manner of " revolution " he envisions is never rendered to specifics , likely for good reason . but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do
549,i really did n't enjoy the movie , but i had to finish it . the hypocrisy of faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that i know , but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying . this movie presented a very perverted view of christianity . though there was alot of talking about jesus and saying his name , it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually knew him and spent time with him . when mary gets a revelation from something she believes is christ that opposed the actual word of god , she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision . christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against his word . no one actually reads a bible in the movie . consequently , most made many life-damaging decisions . i hated the " reality " of the movie , but it has challenged me to actually spend time with christ and learn about him . i shudder to think that i could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what christianity truly is .
550,this product is so good . i love it ! i can make my own mp3 's , make disk copies and archive data files . i 'm curious to see how dvd movies are made with this product . i 'm very happy with this item . the price is very pleasing as well .
551,i purchased this along with a sony dcrhc21. this carry case was listed as an accesory so i expected it to be appropriately sized ( as other sony cases i 've purchased fit like a glove ) . this case is entirely too large to hold a minidv camcorder . the camcorder rattles around inside it . if you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one . otherwise i suggest you look at the product specifications , note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder 's size .
552,i 'm a diehard nikon fan . my first nikon was a gift from my father when i was 13. since then , photography has been a serious hobby , having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college . having said that , and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera , i absolutely agree with them . someone responded by saying those reviewers have n't read the manual . baloney . i bought the coolpix l1 to replace a 4 year old coolpix 850. the l1 's camera 's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors , especially with the macro settings . i 've been patient and have given it three months . i am fed up . this camera is going back to amazon in the morning
553,i saw this at a friends house- -so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy . i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot...not even lukewarm for that matter . the acting is terrible . please...anyone who had anything to do with this , do n't continue in the film industry . if it was possible to assign negative stars , i would do so for this awful experience . run away
554,i work at best buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time . for one its a huge system hog and two it does n't catch much of the pesky spyware . also when computers come in to be cleaned up , no one uses this program ( even though we 're " supposed " to recommend it ) . i would recommend xoft , pest patrol , or ms antispyware much much more .
555,this album is not very good . i am a big fan of life in general , at the show , and slowly going the way of the buffalo but this sucks . i listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip . but i did n't care , becuase it sucked . it was boring , and it had no flavor . not the mxpx i used to know
556,my impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor . it 's all style , no substance . i got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks , long slow camara pans across stephen dorff 's very trendy and stylish haircut , and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with . despite the very art-house feel of it , the story is lost , the viewer is never quite sure if the " philosophy " of the main character is meant to be taken seriously , and the style is nothing we have n't seen done better other places . all in all , i found it pretty vapid , painfully slow , and incredibly frustrating , because there is a good movie in here somewhere , if only the script had gone to someone else to make . on a side note , toby maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser , which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went
557,no one alive today cares that ny had fires in 1741 ( unlike the chicago fire of 1871 ) . why did author lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident . is she trying to create trouble ? be a traitor to her own race ? book is well researched i guess but the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up ! totally unnecessary !
558,this book is very readable because it is oriented to the general reader . chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist , and his experiences in kenya . a forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology . a forensic anthropologist has a ph.d . and studied anthropology , specializing in the human skeletal system . chapter 3 tells about his laboratory , and the tools used for his work . chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on . chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs . the interstate highway system provides arteries for crimes and serial killers . ( p.63 ) . chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide . many people kill themselves without intending to . it is important to distinguish between murder and suicide ( p.86 ) . page 87 tells why florida has an inordinate number of suicides . chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders . this chapter discusses some famous cases of this relatively young science . page 101 tells how to distinguish between bone from rock by taste ! chapter 8 says bones are not solid and unchanging , they are constantly reshaping themselves . in chapter 9 maples tells of the use of capital punishment ( p.128 ) , and discusses the various methods ( pp.129-131 ) . he seems emotionally involved . chapter 10 informs us about cremation . chapter 11 has maples ' most difficult and most fascinating and perplexing case . the two dead in high springs fl were linked to a shocking double murder in new hampshire ( p.152 ) . page jennings ' parents made a big , fatal mistake in sending their daughter so far away after her failure as a freshman ( p.164 ) . chapter 12 deals with the mia in vietnam , about 2200 compared to the 8170 in korea . hollywood movies created this popular image of captured men ( p.187 ) . a " delusion " ( p.188 ) ? maples describes the us army central identification laboratory that identifies remains recovered from vietnam . page 202 tells what happened at the executive office building . chapter 13 tells of his investigation to recognize the skeleton of pizarro , and correct an old mistake . the exhumation of president zachary taylor and the tests for arsenic poisoning are told in chapter 14. page 224 tells of his importance to those times : he backed free states in the new territories . his replacement changed his policies . chapter 15 may be the most historically important . maples was part of a team that identified the bones of tsar nicholas and his family . maples draws political conclusions from " rotten , neglected teeth " ( p.259 ) . chapter 16 tells of the murder of five college students over two days in gainesville florida . maples identified the murder weapon ( pp.271-273 ) . the book concludes with the complaint that states are not funding forensic anthropologists , who are few and far between , especially in florida ( pp.278-279 ) . florida is " the most crime-ridden state in the union " . that is a political decision for each state government . this recalls the most realistic portion of " quincy , m.e. " : whenever quincy wanted to do more research , his manager often said " there 's no money in the budget " !
559,you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have . do n't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it . many changes are literally imposed on you , like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars . missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return . there are new features which can be helpful to some , but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining . the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible . you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual .
560,if you want a feel good , come home from work and forget your day cd you found it her
561,love this product , have been using oil of olay before it was heard of by most.this is more advanced and makes my skin look and feel more youthful
562,a generation before there was a left behind , there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c . c . carlson . this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america . a phemomenal best seller , it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry . for many christians , their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future . a generation later , many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture , sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events , and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated . so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism ? well , while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events , it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other " prophecy pundits . " while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism , it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book . part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form . for lahaye and jerry b . jenkins , it was the pulp novel . back in 1970 , lindsay and c . c . carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose . like most books of this type ( e.g. , the bermuda triangle , chariots of the gods ? , the philadelphia experiment , the population bomb ) , it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts . like most of these books , it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams . like most of these books , it is laughable in retrospect . if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes , i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp . the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong . after all , it was the 1970 's when wild conspiracy theories , distrust of any traditional authority , and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage . when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age , a ufo invasion , a famine around the corner , and california falling into the pacific ocean , the authors ' claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy . however , in the intervening years , the revisions of this book just kept piling up . make a bad prediction ? no problem , edit the book with the old gaffes removed , add a few trendier predictions , and release it as a new book . lindsey , now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years , still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis ( carleton 's contribution is more stylistic ) despite his failed scenarios . lindsey 's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s ( he even wrote a book the 1980's : countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief ) . well that did n't pan out , so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon ( another of his books was planet earth 2000 a.d. : will mankind survive ? ) . oops , wrong again . first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam ( a more recent book is the everlasting hatred : the roots of jihad ) . when one bogeyman falls , he is quick to insert a new one in its place . between the failed predictions , the hilarious misreadings of the original languages , the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology , and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies " right before our eyes " , it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things . this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the left behind series of novels . if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970 , it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time . just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism , fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night . however , for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy , it is best to pass . for all its success as a cultural marker , its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil . for this , its original purpose , the late great planet earth is completely worthless .
563,the game disk does not run on my laptop . but it will play it on my desktop computer . very annoying , but at least i can play ( other reviewers have not been so lucky ) . the game has some good questions and i enjoy testing my friends knowledge . the game itself is rather simple and not totally fun . the " game board " is the outside of the friends ' apartment building . when you get a question right a window lights up . when you get one wrong a window dims . if you do n't answer the question nothing happens . you win when all the windows on that floor are lit up . i would prefer that they make you answer all questions - none of this passing on a question - it would up the ante and perhaps add some excitement . if you play a multi-player game you cannot select which letter is your buzzer and the letters assigned by the game designers are adjacent keys on the keyboard ! it 's silly for the two players to be huddled together , hovering over the same part of the keyboard when the designers could have selected other letter keys set further apart . there are some video clips and still images accompanying the questions , but it 's mostly a trivia game without visual aids or embellishments . think trivial pursuit with a computer screen as the cards . this game was a gift . if i had to do it over again i 'd probably spend my money instead on scene it ! friends edition . as of right now , scene it ! friends edition is on sale at circuit city for the same price as this game is on amazon . ( and though i have n't played it , the reviews of that game are much better than this one ) .
564,this is the perfect cd for taking a nap to . it 's mostly full of slow pop and rock . if you 're a fan of this type of music , i recommend this cd , but if not , do n't buy it . there are only a few good tracks . all star , bad reputation , i 'm a believer , stay home . and i do n't enjoy buying a cd that only 1 / 3 of it is good . so , i would n't buy it , if i were you .
565,i would recommend this book to anyone studying & quot ; romeo and juliet . &quot ; i would have never made it through english class without this book
566,i purchased this lens back in march of 2005 to shoot static " warhammer models " with my 10d . i found that longer lenses such as the sigma 105mm , the canon ef 100mm , and the tamron sp autofocus 90mm all were " too long " with the 10d 's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what i had room for to get the shot . the canon ef 50mm f / 2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10d for this purpose . its small , its compact , and its short focal length do not require that i be standing three feet away from the model i 'm shooting . as far as shooting at non-static objects , such as insects , the lens is slow to focus and loud , in both noise and vibration , which results in " startled " subjects and missed shots . the same also applies for non-macro shots as well . its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography , and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well
567,we purchased this to make sure we did n't miss anything re : stock options . the program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type , though they were not entered twice . it took me quite sometime to get them deleted . it also said we had to pay estimated tax next year-which is n't true since we overpaid ( as we have always done ) . too many errors for a tax program
568,i love destiny 's child...but this cd...big disappointment . the best songs on the entire cd were probably lose my breath , cater 2 u and girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the cd when i bought it. .
569,6.6 ultra is an extremely good cd / dvd burning suite . it even has an excellent schedule-able backup / restore utility that burns to disk . do not use the oem version - it 's like diet nero . and do not for any reason get nero 7.0. you have less than a 50% chance that it will work at all . ( i am speaking from experience here !
570,robert ryan made a number of westerns during the 1950s and ' 60s , but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre . nevertheless , who can forget the wild bunch or his magnificent portrayal of " old man clanton " in the seriously underrated hour of the gun ( with james garner ) . and his self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in the day of the outlaw . now one of his best roles , as the straight-arrow sheriff in the proud ones is on dvd and available at a very reasonable price . finally . the proud ones is perhaps director robert webb 's finest picture , combining great action scenes and plot twists , taught dialogue , and a superior cast that includes not only ryan , but jeffrey hunter , walter brennan , virginia mayo , and robert middleton . minor roles are given attention as well , especially arthur o'connell ( as ryan 's deputy ) and , important thematically , the wonderful paul burns , who plays the town drunk and panhandler....hunter , when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff , will give alms to burns at the finish of the movie , just as ryan did at the beginning , when he was sheriff . this touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about hunter 's increased maturity . the proud ones is a superb movie , with a great story...it will repay re-viewing . unlike some westerns , i do n't tire of watching it periodically . it is that good.. .
571,i must agree with some other reviewers of this book , and say that it is a very dry list of factual data , interspersed with bill wyman 's moans and boasts . his gripe with allan klein about money seems to be quite valid , but he mentions it about a thousand times . mick and keith get quite a pasting - again it seems quite valid , but do we need to hear it so many times ? bill opines that keith richard 's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band . listen to his only self-penned stones track of the 60s , on & quot ; satanic majesties&quot ; , and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion - his voice is far weaker , and his songwriting at that time was also inferior . the book seems to be more authoritative on dates , but we can only take bill 's accuracy on faith . my knowledge of the stones is not enormous , but even i can see some big factual errors . for example he tells us that neither taj mahal nor marianne faithfull recorded songs for the & quot ; rock n roll circus&quot ; . a recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong . as another reviewer rightly said , marianne faithfull 's autobiog is a much better read
572,i got this camera so i could have more control . i 'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings...i have n't explored all the fancy settings much , but there are tons of them . i really like the continuous shooting option so i 'm more likely to catch a good action shot . the wide-angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close-ups . i think it 's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos , but do n't feel quite ready for an slr
573,great smell . worth the cost . cleans great . i have used this laundry soap for quite some time now and happy .
574,what i love most about scofield 's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style . he is careful not to over do it , while still demonstrating skill and precision . his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed . the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs , i rarely make it to the end of this cd . still for those who enjoyed & quot ; a go-go&quot ; , this one is quite similar , so make sure to pick it up . this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking , but is a great casual listen . ( guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas here !
575,i hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful " supergroups " . ca n't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more ? there 's no such thing as a good supergroup . the supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck . when damn yankees released their 1990 debut , every song on it was so incredibly generic , there was no hope for this band . the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together . they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs , it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their " supergroup " scam . the big , booming , arena rock choruses just ring hollow . i guess they 're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks , but to me , it just sounds like a lot of filler . supergroups will always suck , because they diliberately try to sound bad ! thats right people ! supergroup members know that since they 're already popular , the album they 're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller- -- - " why bother trying to come up with good songs ? we 're already popular , so people will buy it no matter how bad it is ! lets just put out filler . " supergroups are a total farce , its just easy money for the people involved , and nothing more . if you buy any album by any supergroup , than you my friend , are a sucker ! if you want to hear shaw or blades at their best , just keep listening to any styx or night ranger album , and avoid anything by damn yankees , or any other supergroup
576,i 've been frustrated for quite some time now with having adobe reader and expecting it should do what adobe acrobat can do . i was especially interested in creating pdf 's ( portable document formats ) of word documents . although i have photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way , i was n't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so . faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook , aptly named , " death by cholesterol " , i felt justified in finally purchasing not only " acrobat " but also " omnipage " , an ocr ( optical character recognition ) software . with these programs in hand it made the project fun to do . now i have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page pdf file that can be read and also printed out by anyone i care to send it to over the internet . it 's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though i 've only used a small part of its capabilities . the reason that i 've only given it a " 4 " rating ? i 'm upset that i did n't get the full version , but i ca n't justify doing so . i 'm being petulant
577,i bought this item for a present , and the person really liked it ! ! . he uses it to watch deer , and other animals . the focus is very good , and i am very happy that i bought this product !
578,this disk is truly as bad as nitin 's previous disks were wonderful . take any previous nitin disk , throw in some alpha , a bit of craig armstrong , some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe , mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy . as with most prophesies there no good news about it . my prophesy is that anyone who buys this wo n't ever buy another nitin dis
579,zig ziglar has done it again . as an author myself of sales books , i realize sales is about so much more than just having the ' gift of gab , ' and fast talking . it 's about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers . it 's about not just being a consultant to others , but being a consultant to yourself . it 's recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is . zig 's theories exemplify this .
580,the pins for the curlers are awkward and hard to use . i do n't like them
581,this is one of those movies that you have to ask , " why remake a movie that did it right the first time ! ! ! buy the 1968 version and forget this one ! skip it !
582,this movie was much better than " vanilla sky . " " vanilla sky " mostly copied " open your eyes " but was too obvious and less convincing . ( and tom cruise , though good in some roles , did n't fit this role well . ) " open your eyes " takes a little longer to draw you in , but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where " vanilla sky " does . also , the jungian dream aspect in " vanilla sky " is poorly done , whereas " open your eyes " represents the dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you 're going to buy , get " open your eyes .
583,this massive volume encloses most of the major theorists in criticsm and theory , this book is essential reading for literary theorists and those people who are interested in reading the original texts of the greatest thinkers in history
584,i had no prior experience with music playing ( other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica ) and , yet , i found this book to be surprisingly easy to learn from . it smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing , starting with one-hand playing , but quickly to two-hands , then chords , etc. , and ending with sharp and flat notes . it is well organized , has well thought out exercises , advices , and a diverse collection of ( short ) attractive tunes of increasing complexity ( from jingle bells to waltzing matilda to silent night to green sleeves to we shall overcome to minuet in g minor ) . i prefer it to other teach-yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills , such as the complete piano player or piano for dummies . i particularly like that it gets to two-hand playing almost right away , which i feel is better preparation- -even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially . it may have helped ( coordination-wise ) that i have been typing for 20+ years with both hands . if you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way , then i recommend this book . if you perfer a slower pace , then maybe look elsewhere . for me , this was the perfect book to learn from .
585,this product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes . this is the first time we 've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete . you can go back and change things or review them , it gives you a way to e-file , you can print out all the copies that you may need . i was surprised how easy it was to use . however it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer . i was very happy with it
586,i have many robot books and this is the best and most informative book of all . it is easy to understand and read ; i personally could n't put it down . i wish it was twice as long while still marinating the high info density.. . most authors just babble and every few pages actually tell you something ; this is not the case with this book ! the programming of a robot is everything.. . and behavior based programming is the only way to go . this book provides a very good intro into that very subject . the only complaint i have is not about the book but his robot simulation program on is website which is referred to in the text . it seems to be rather slow and over taxing for the pc , but being a java app it 's not that surprising . highly recommended to anyone building robots
587,it is a great disappointment with amazon when it pushed to sell a product , wes9006pc replacement inner blade and outer foil combination for pro curve linear shavers without indicating that they are not compatible with the panasonic es8162s pro curve elite convex wet / dry shaver i purchased . amazon displaced those two products next to each other as though if i made a purchase those products together i would save money . now i was forced to buy one more shaver that would be compatible with wes9006pc replacement .
588,i thought i was fairly familiar with the sanibel island area , but this book definitely gave me new insight . the author definitely " knows her stuff " and has written a very informative and interesting guide . anyone visiting sanibel ( especially first-timers ) should definitely get a copy before they go .
589,i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit . the glass itself was intact , but something underneath was clearly broken . mailed it in to the factory service company for sony , and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $181 to repair . this is 2 / 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially . i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera .
590,everything has been said about this product . when it 's working , you 're happy . with my 8 version , almost everything was fine . with the 10 version , it 's a bloody nightmare . i 'm giving up , throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd . never pinnacle again
591,essential for microsoft office 2007 users running windows vista . office 2007 already provides a pdf converter ; however , it does not allow for security , editing , or markup . pdf converter does- -and without the tech support hassles at adobe . since my new hp computer came with adobe reader already installed in the vista environment , i kept it as the default pdf reader , and i use pdf converter professional for actual , stand alone conversion or editing of pdf documents . pdf converter had a very easy custom install feature . i disabled all microft office , internet explorer , and outlook add-ins , and i installed the product . it all works together extremely well .
592,the setting of this book is beautiful , exotic , and interesting . the author , unfortunately , does nothing to take advantage of this . i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award . it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless , or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year - - which i doubt . the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else , as far as i am concerned . i ca n't imagine it being done worse ! tuck 's writing style - - short vignettes or episodes , one after another - - is terribly ineffective and disjointed . i felt completely detached from all of the characters . i did n't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were , and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies . another thing that completely irritated me were tuck 's sexual references . throughout the novel , tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter ( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest , for example ) . these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader ; all they did was gross me out . they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy , not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story . i do n't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel . i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level : it is not entertaining . it is not profound . it is not educational . it is not beautiful . at only 248 pages , i ca n't say it was even a quick read . utterly forgettable , once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it .
593,overall , i found this book disappointing . in its defense , its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the ` right ' ( more closed and intensely religious ) is interesting , and i am sure accurate , and heilman 's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched . however , i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system , or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all . heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader , and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations . examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture . hareidi society has its own worldview which , although too complex to elaborate on here , has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values , reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores . ( for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author , yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try " real jews " by noah efron ) . in general , i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct ( i.e. a defensive reaction to the holocaust ) to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition . the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information . for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well . or two posters ( put out by the same company ) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music . in conclusion , although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent , my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information .
594,i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work . this is terrible , terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product .
595,in installed this product on a dell optiplex gx110 ( admittedly not the latest , but still a very standard machine ) running windows 2000 with 512mb of memory . in spite of spending literally hours with the software i was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse , as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video . without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls . multiple emails to broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that i refer to their website for help . this site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems ( like not being able to read the install cd ) . it would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver . be prepared for possible frustrations with this product , with little support from the manufacturer . i cannot report on other features of the software because i was never able to produce even the walls of a structure
596,okay , after reading several reviews , i decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs . boy did i get my moneys worth ! it was so incredibly bad that i was first cringing in horror before i started laughing . the characters , especially hiei , were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing . now , i 'm a die hard yyh fan , but i give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch . put me in a good mood for the rest of the day . if you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i 'd definitely suggest buying for th he11 of it
597,if you are looking for a good small camera , and have no intentions of being ansel adams , this is a good camera choice . i travel alot , and this camera is perfect because it can fit in my pockets or a small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures
598,i bought this camera for its great price , good reviews , and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter . i returned the camera after three weeks , however , due to abysmal low light performance among other things . the catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child . i took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor / delivery and follow up . unfortunately , when we returned home to view our footage , much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes . the camera does include a light and a magicpix option , but unless you 're using a tripod , you 're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect ( perfect for recreating " thriller music videos , " but not much help otherwise . ) i also found the image quality with the gs31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated . granted , you get what you pay for , but i was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage . that being said , the camera did a lot better in good / outdoor lighting ( albeit still somewhat pixilated ) , and the zoom is incredible . the camera is very light and smaller than i anticipated . in the end , i returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment ( ... ) i will say that amazon did a great job with customer service throughout . also , if you do buy this camera , make sure to buy the dv cable ( firewire for macs ) through amazon or some other online retailer . ( ...
599,i got what i expected . it 's functional and not too poorly made . the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp . i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great . the rolling wheels still have no function for me , but they do n't get in the way
600,this is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape , grounded firmly in love and faithfulness . it moves quickly ; i was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant . the grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that 's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of julie and abu . and it is not transient but deepens . miriam , abu 's sister , remains with me in her moving quietude , and the litle girl lela , hand in hand with julie , plucks deep
601,i thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits from the mamas and the papas . every song is fun and the tunes will stay with you long after you 're done listening . like other selections from the 20th century masters series , this ca n't be called a complete collection . however , what is included is fantastic and i find myself popping it into my cd player much more often than many other cds . my copy of this cd ( which i bought new ) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band ( besides the cover photo ) , a short band biography written by joseph f . laredo , and a track listing with song writing and original release credits . song lyrics are not included . the jewel case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the inside of the back paper . as a side note , if you are a fan of the abc television series " lost " this cd includes the mama cass song " make your own kind of music " that is featured on desmond 's record player in the hatch . if you 're just starting with the mamas and the papas , or simply want a brief overview of some of their better known songs , this is a great cd . for more the mamas and the papas , check out criterion 's phenomenal dvd release of monterey pop ( or the box set the complete monterey pop festival ) . this concert dvd is absolutely brilliant , and includes several songs from the mamas and the papas .
602,i have to say i was getting worried that john adams was becoming a has-been . el nino 's first half was much better than the second , i did n't particularly like transmigration and i defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work american berserk and tell me it 's any good . but after this release , i stand humbly corrected - - he 's still , in my opinion , america 's , if not the world 's , best living composer . dharma at big sur is scored for an electric violin and orchestra and uses a tuning system that 's not well-tempered . what really makes this work special is the way the electric violinist plays soulfully and beautifully above the orchestra for almost the entire work in a sliding style i 've never heard before in classical music . the first movement " a new day " with its quiet and contemplative opening really feels like it 's the creation of an entire universe . the climax of the second movement might be the most satisfying conclusion to any of adams 's works to date . dharma is an absolute masterpiece . my father knew charles ives is wonderful too , even if it 's not as powerful or moving as dharma . the work is both an homage to ives and a reflection of adams ' life . clearly , adams had a great childhood . the first movement , concord , is playful - - the clearest tribute to ives , since it 's sounds structurarlly similar to his fourth of july . the chaos in adams ' concord is a little more rigid than ives ' , but it 's still fun . the second movement , " the lake " , features a beautiful clarinet line that evokes the composer 's father . the scurrying of the last movement , " the mountain " , seems needlessly frenetic at times , but the cathartic ending that results of it makes the voyage worth it . my one bone to pick is with nonesuch . the two works together represent about 52 minutes worth of music - - an amount that many would already consider stingy on a single cd , especially when other works like guide to strange places go unrecorded . so why put these two works on 2 cds ? is it to justify the $20 sticker price ? an artistic statement to completely separate the two works ? it just seems silly . but it 's also forming a nasty pattern of sub-30 minute cds that really should stop . people want to hear the astonishing sound world that adams creates - - why try to limit it to 25 minutes at a time ? buy this disc , even if it 's split into 2 pieces . it 's the best of his works yet
603,very happy with this purchase . received it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate for signing up for an [...] credit card . it is easy to use and seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors . i like the history feature in order to determine the average blood pressure over a long period of time since pressures change daily ! good machine especially since it has an ac adapter so that there is no need to change batteries frequently ! also , the intellisense feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before readings
604,when a young artist names her first two albums not & quot ; judy&quot ; or & quot ; collins&quot ; but & quot ; a maid of constant sorrow&quot ; and & quot ; golden apples of the sun&quot ; , you know she takes herself seriously.originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were all i knew until i saw this cd recently . &quot ; who will buy this ? & quot ; i wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me.the comparisons with first two baez albums are inevitable ( some songs were recorded by both ) althought collins shows much more passion and involment where baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.on these early albums collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain ( to some ears , overpowering ) seriousness , cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous & quot ; o daddy be gay&quot ; , a cousin to her & quot ; grandfather&quot ; recorded years later.althought i honestly love these songs and listen only this cd for days , these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of collins later trademarks ( voice will soar much higher in the future , she slipped w.b.yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer ) and as they were product of their greenwich village times , they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.but they are still hauntingly beautiful to me , i waited their re-release for too long
605,i have had this camera for about six months and i still find new features to play with . one of my favorite mode is the sequence shots . i love its sleek design and its durable shell . i carry the camera in my back pocket , even in my tightest jeans . this is a great camera
606,poor and slow focus and flash . thought nikon had a good name.......wrong if you like this camera it must be you first digital
607,it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment , considering the makeup of the cast : nicolas cage , bridget fonda , and rosie perez among others . the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the ny state lotto , decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day . the acting is surprisingly ( ! ) below average , the dialogues are way below average , while the plot is not bad at all . nicolas cage 's character is too naive and too slow , and that was just sad / pitiful ! bridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland . rosie perez 's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on . as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing ; they do n't seem to belong . subsequently , they are not convincing in their roles at all . finally , somebody shoot the " narrator , " please ! though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off . a shame really.. . no masterpiece here . if nicolas cage is what you had in mind , check out the amazing movies city of angels and / or the family man .
608,i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf-10 when this case was on back order . it was terrrible , so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased . the camera fits perfectly into the case and , although it is described as a " soft case , " it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk
609,i had mcafee iss 2006 and loved it . i bought 2007 when my subscription expired . oh my dear god ! ! what have i done ! ! the thing is complete crap . my computer is 1 year old with duel core chip and 2gb of memory . this thing never crashed . i loaded 2007 and it was crashing every 5 minutes ! ! i could not get on the internet with my browsers . mcafee was updating and microsoft was reporting the serious errors with no problem , but forget about trying to get help from their website . they have got to be kidding ! ! i tried to uninstall it , forget about it . i was able to get enough of it off so that my computer is able to access the internet and not crash every 5 minutes . thanks alot mcafee , you took a good product and turned it into crap and made a mess of my computer . i downloaded a free firewall and avg anti virus .
610,what a great account of the nations oldest law enforcement agency . the book is full of information about the marshals service , it 's mission , and it 's history . you 'll also get to know some interesting personalities in the marshals service along the way . i am a deputy sheriff myself , as well as a history buff . from that perspective , i throughly enjoyed this book and could n't put it down . mr. sabbag , thanks for a great look into the world of the u.s. marshals . and as for deputy u.s. marshal victor oboyski - i 'd be happy to & quot ; do a door&quot ; with you anytime
611,this movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage i have ever seen . aniston 's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him . that is total nonsense . i expected them to get back together in the end . real people do not behave like this . or maybe they do.. . it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country
612,i installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running vista and had a small problem . so , i bought an upgrade to 2007 since intuit says it works with vista . it does not . the software crashes at odd times . it also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report . it reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day . i have set up my old computer , which runs xp , so i can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version . i recommend not buying this version if you are running vista os
613,having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch , i was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas , to see what a commercial frame would be like . after using it for a few weeks , i have to say that if it was n't a present i would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation . the good : * screen is bright , images look great * resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me . does n't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen . * computer connection worked great - i plugged it into my xp box , all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up . it would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue . the bad : my main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before . if i bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50 , i could have forgiven it for the poor design , but in 2007 , for $180 , it is completely unacceptable . we live in the future here people , get with the program ! i have not used other frames on the market , but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12 " screen on ebay for $70 , strap it into a cheap frame and make your own , pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame , just by running a screen saver for under $150 , i 'd say this frame is not worth the money at all . this screen just does n't deliver the goods for the price . some details : * menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance , you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the " setup " button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global * remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny ir hole in the front of the screen . * screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame ( i.e. as a 480x640 frame ) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this " feature " off . * the slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images . your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that does n't change . * no way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system . * good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens
614,this is easily the worst beard trimmer i 've used . it slips and cuts hair much shorter than anticipated , and the teeth on the guard are far too fine
615,this is a great value - probably one of the best shower heads i 've used . yes - there are better ones for $100+ , but this is absolutely amazing
616,i cannot agree with any person who gives this over 1 star . the main problem i had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department . i swear , it was like bathing in gatorade . and while i 'm sure that axe was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory , but the smell is far too fragrant . and if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality , think again . i was a lot happier with snake peel
617," the case for faith " is the weakest volume in a strong series . strobel 's format is fun and engaging . i find his books as " un-put-downable " as any blockbuster page-turner . strobel holds a degree from yale law school , and he was an award-winning legal editor at the chicago tribune . he begins with a question : " does historical evidence support the historicity of jesus ? does current science support the existence of a creator god ? does it make sense to have faith in god ? " and then travels north america , interviewing acknowledged , academic experts on the question at hand . some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web protest : " but , strobel 's books are n't fair , because he only presents one side ! " perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books , titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books . the first three words of each title is , " the case for.. . " no , strobel is not presenting the case *against* his topic ; he does n't represent himself as doing so . our christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly ; why should strobel waste paper and time doing that , when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing ? strobel 's accounts of his interviews of the experts are always reader-friendly , but he never talks down to his reader . if you do n't want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing , but want to get to the nub of the issue , strobel is your man . these techniques worked excellently in " the case for a creator " and " the case for christ , " but less well in " the case for faith . " there are three remarkably strong episodes in the book ; these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks . in the introduction , strobel interviews canadian evangelist turned atheist charles templeton . templeton presents a righteous , enraged case *against* god , and then , tearfully , admits how much he continues to adore jesus , and , indeed , to miss him . this wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a love-hate relationship with their creator . in a few brief pages that serve as coda to chapter one , which addresses the question of suffering , strobel 's friend marc harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car . this very brief account is testimony to the power of faith , even in the face of profound suffering . in another brief passage , strobel tells of his friend ron bronski , who went from being a vicious criminal to being a christian minister . these highly personal passages are what i will remember best from this book ; they were the most rewarding to read . the formal interviews with the experts did n't do a lot for me , and some were alienating . norman geisler 's treatment of the slaughter of the amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns . it may be true that in war , children are killed with their adults - - when the us bombed german and japanese cities during ww ii we killed children as well as adults - - but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than geisler manages to convey . too , there is doubt , if not complete disbelief , among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place ( see israel finkelstein . ) the chapter entitled " church history is littered with oppression and violence " was especially weak , compared to other treatments of the same material . strobel 's treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from lyndal roper 's work . strobel does n't handle understandings of nazism as a christian phenomenon well at all . the insistence that nazism was a christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact , and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter . nazism was a pagan and a scientific phenomenon . the pagan swastika was to replace the christian cross . scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace " weak " christian ideas about humanity 's unity as god 's children and the value of all life . this is not made clear enough in strobel 's account . all in all , i have to say i 've encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books ... and yet , strobel is such a good writer , and his technique is so engaging , that you could do worse than to read this book . read the other two books in the series first , though .
618,i was a music director at a college radio station when this came out , and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention . shoegazers ? ? ? i am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces . its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger . just buy it...and all the rest
619,these books will one day be recorded as history told before its time . while the mainstream shurgs him now , he will be required reading years to come
620,i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years . however , this book is misleading and dangerous . almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem ( except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries ) . writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - mr. crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen , and provide plenty of " references " to support this premise . tragically , in the long term , global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust . i hope that someday mr. crichton recognizes that , in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining , he has enormous influence on people 's thoughts and actions through his books . there is a quote : " with great power comes great responsibility . " but in this case it would seem : " with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet .
621,now that i 'm writing this review , it seems silly that i 'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i had my first ( and hopefully only ) root canal and crown four years ago , something which i never again want to experience in my life ( as someone else described , it was painful and expensive ) . growing up , i did n't take care of my teeth like i should 've , so i 'm accustomed to always being told there 's either a cavity , or the start of one , and having to have more work done . after the root canal , my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations / oscillations , because that 's what she 'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , and it was affordable . when i first started using it , my gums were very sensitive to it , but that quickly wore off , so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums . it is also much easier to get behind the front teeth . subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one ( i honestly do n't remember if she has this exact model , but ours are similar ) , and i 've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . as far as cleaning the unit to keep it from " gunking " up , i 'm the only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in , not dripping into the storage container ; so i do n't know how to combat that . but i just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it , then rinse the hand-held part , and set them back on the unplugged charger / base ( i only plug it in when the battery runs low ) and things stay clean with no problem
622,i was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch live 8 and certainly regretted that . however , i was fortunate enough to find this copy at amazon and it 's been everything i had expected and more . i 'm a huge pink floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances . i would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation- -truly a " must have " for anyone 's collection !
623,i was required to purchase this with my new computer . i thought i 'd give it a chance at work . we have a dedicated wired network , which just requires that you register the machine 's mac address with our dhcp server . nice and simple , and very much like the lan in any home where the user has a nat router . i plugged in the network and tried to get the mac address . vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network . ok , i tried the wizard . it offers to let me setup pppoe with a username and password . that 's it , no other options . i asked for other options , and it only offered that i use a modem ( that i did not have in my computer . ) no options for a dedicated network at all , that i could find . i went to another machine ( on the ' net ) and searched google . none of the microsoft sites were helpful in any way . lots of pr posturing , but no useful information or troubleshooting . i gave up , found the license and install disks for windows xp , and downgraded the new machine . it was far , far easier .
624,until ' 07 , if you had a mcafee suite but only wanted to use some of its components , and use other programs for other aspects of protection , that worked fine . for instance , i use zone alarm pro for firewall and spyware doctor for spyware , and mcafee ' 06 just for virus . this combination has worked fine , but mcafee ' 07 wo n't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed . and that 's a no-go for me , since some components of mcafee ( esp spyware ) were n't rated all that well by reviewers .
625,i rarely write reviews but i decided to write this since i had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad . the review by " reviewer : rc lansing mich " has listed all of my frustrations and i will not go over them again . but the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review . the summary of this product is that it is " highly unusable " . you will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again . yes , you can " manage " you way with this product . however it is not worth your time and money . and last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps , based on locations they have travelled , not covered by the original map database ... come on !
626,one of the best-directed films of 2006 , " kiss kiss bang bang " is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences . and even though " kiss kiss bang bang " may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue , or to untangle the plot , one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill : it 's a class-a tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that shane black pulls off here , with " kkbb " ' s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy . if that seems like an easy feat , well.. . remember " 1941 " ? not even spielberg got it right . but shane black nails it here - - and it 's his directorial debut . downey & kilmer are also at the top of their game here , but it 's michelle monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans . " sui generis " ( one-of-a-kind ) is the phrase that best describes " kiss kiss bang bang , " although it 's remarkably mainstream at times . it 's a showcase of talents for everyone involved , and when the bullets are n't flying , there 's even a romantic comedy here & social commentary to boot . i ca n't think of any other film quite like it - - and that 's just how the warner brothers tradition seems to work ( at its best ) .
627,this book is a really excellent source for anyone wanting to understand the reasons that saudi arabia is the way it is today . i was lucky to find my copy in a used bookstore . it does get a little tedious when discussing the business / oil aspects of the 1960 's and 70 's , but it 's well worth it . it 's a detailed history from start until publishing and that is definitely a relevant time .
628,i love this book ! it is a terrific blend of hand-holding and concrete advice for writers . each chapter takes the writer / reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write : how do we begin ? where do ideas come from ? is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin ? i like the fact that i could use this book as a resource . in other words , i did not have to read it cover to cover . rather , it truly serves as a guide , a mentor 's guide , that can serve me as i continue to write . i really liked the movie section , where cathleen rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process . i found those sections inspirational and useful . if you want to be a writer or if you are already writing , i urge you to buy this book
629,on the dvd first band on the moon been it - us promo video interactive picture gallery synopsis swedish indie pop combo the cardigans deliver a stellar performance for their british fans in this performance video . the cardigans : live in london was recorded during a concert at the shepherds bush empire in late 1996 , as the group were touring in support of their breakthrough album , first band on the moon . the 16-song set includes " lovefool , " " rise and shine , " " your new cuckoo , " " nasty sunny beam , " " never recover , " and more
630,this is a very thorough , very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states , and while it may not be as easily readable as , say , david mccullough 's & quot ; truman&quot ; , it is certainly less dry and slow-going than most scholarly works . if you 're looking for a full-life biography of monroe , one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure 's life , this is an excellent choice . if you 're looking for light reading with a historical basis , this is definitely not what you 're looking for
631,this was the word used by one reviewer , and it just about sums up the film . another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto-biographical and introspective pieces of work . usually these are binned , as the person matures . asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well-heeled to let her have her way on film , instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority . but good art is more than self-expression , self-promotion , self-pity and self-indulgence . it should have a satisfying underlying form , say something new to its audience , expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity . art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know , especially if it 's told in a semi-familiar way . most of what asia says in this film we do already know , if we are half-aware of what goes on around us . still , the girl has a cute face , and she 's put a lot of effort into this performance . something more may come with time .
632,juice newton is one of the best counry-pop singers of all times . a great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs . my personal favourites include the beautiful angel of the morning , the rollicking queen of hearts and the strong and sorrowful it 's a heartache after all these years , her work is unforgettable , catchy and full of energy and vibe
633,' clownhouse ' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor . while hearing of salva 's conviction when ' jeepers creepers ' came out , i never knew it had anything to do with this movie , nor had i ever heard of this in the first place . i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides ' it ' , and came across this weird little ' halloween' -like suspense tale . while the sex scandal never once popped into my head ( except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid ) , i still did n't care for this too much , despite its pluses . like ' halloween ' , this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out , but sadly , it did n't really get to me . if i was about 9 or so , this would 've scared the hell out of me . i 'm not saying i hated this ; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images , but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children , it lost some effect for me . i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on , and it would 've been a creepier experience . horror movie fans should like this , even though i personally thought it would be better . the atmosphere is very , very creepy , and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way , but it just did n't do it for me . rent it first
634,do n't let the product description fool you into thinking it will work with a zr85mc camcorder . it did n't work with mine . it did n't even fit
635,i waited over 30 years to see this film , and now that i have - - i 'm glad i waited that long . its glaring defects might not have been so obvious to me 30 years ago . nicholas , alexandra , their daughters , their son , the people surrounding them - - not only are they not fictional , but thanks to the era in which they lived , they were photographed , we know what they actually looked like . so who on earth did the casting ? ! it was impossible to tell one grand duchess from another , and as for alexandra - - in the first few scenes , i had trouble distinguishing the actress from someone in drag . janet suzman was the worst casting flub of all , unless you count the stilted manner in which michael jayston delivered his lines . what a stiff and boring character he makes nicholas to be . yet there are photos extant of nicholas smiling as he played with his children . nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as tsar . but in the robert massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled , it was very clear that nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the russian people , as well as to his family , and above all his son , the future tsar . there was nothing exceptional about his behavior ; most of europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens , and to all of them , the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable . yet this film falls into the trap most of us do , of judging history not on the basis of its own terms , but with our usual spectacularly accurate 20 / 20 hindsight . having been fed soviet propaganda for 75 years , we have it entrenched in our minds that nicholas was an extremely poor ruler . that 's the stunning success of the massie book , that someone who had absolutely no connection to russians , and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia , was able to overcome the general ( and erroneous ) " knowledge " of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking . the movie , on the other hand , makes nicholas look petty , and alexandra slightly over the edge . one petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to nicholas 's sending off his troops into world war i . it was badly researched , to the point of ludicrousness . the tsars of russia were all orthodox christians . orthodox christianity has its own very distinctive music ; in fact , russian orthodox chant is very different from greek orthodox chant . so what kind of background music did the director choose ? gregorian , of course ! can we at least *strive* for a little authenticity ? ! apparently not . massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the romanovs towards their captors , how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the bolsheviks : " you are n't anything like what we thought , " was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject . the movie showed nothing of that . well - - in the end , it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the romanov family canonized in the russian orthodox church . that movement was well underway by 1971 ; i wonder , if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research , if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures . all in all , purchasing the movie was a waste of money . maybe the bolsheviks over at the university 's russian department will appreciate my donating it - - that way , others can get to see it without wasting their money
636,i have pergo and cannot get it too wet or the floor will bubble . the swiffer wet cloths are the perfect solution . they 're so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you 're done . i hate that i 'm consuming a product that is so disposable , but at the same time , it works so well
637,i was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by cat stevens ( his name then ) . i was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection . i was , and still am , a fan of his music . nice to see a dvd concert of his . it is old music , but if you 're a fan of the man , you 'll enjoy it
638,neither my husband or i could get into the movie . i dont think i would ever watch this film again . it was not what it was made out to be
639,this is a useful tool in that it makes the software / hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other i am aware of . my only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output , although from reading heart math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing . however for the price it is definitely worth it and i could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack
640,patronizing , dreadful , insincere , badly written book . i cut my losses after about four chapters of this fool 's memoir . i do n't recommend it
641,acrobat 5 was so buggy that i thought i 'd give adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading . should have waited longer . there have been improvements in v7 : a better look , better commenting , the ability to add text that actually prints , and far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions are way worse than in v5 : some word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7 , seems to be something to do with font license issues . installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs , clashes with standard security software , and endless errors in the automatic update feature . the new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone . despite my already low expectations of adobe , this product is a disappointment . with acrobat 7 , adobe is , as usual , charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version . ( for reference , my system is window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5gb ram )
642,this camera is excellent one ! ! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category , i 'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles. . highly recommended
643,this book was very boring . details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating . this book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it . a poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book . what does that show about the book ?
644,i found the product to work very well for antivirus , spyware and spam . it is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance . i had been using norton 2004 , but it only did a good job on viruses . although it would detect spyware after the fact , it did a poor job of removing them . i had also used the ms beta , which although detected more spyware than norton , would not block it . i had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware . since i installed pc-cillin , i 've had no problems . i 've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well , catching about 80% of the spam . i had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook , that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam , so this is a big improvement . my only complaint is the rebate - i sent in the required info and it was rejected due to " invalid / missing ups . " i then sent a copy of the ups they indicated that was missing , but never got anything back .
645,we love this item ! ! ! we get older tv show dvds from netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come . if the cleaner does n't work , and it generally does , our back up is the repair stuff , which almost always does . i think out of 30 disks , only two were not fixed .
646,this is the best and easiest to use back brush ! i have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just did n't do it but with this brush no more missed spots . just hang it up and it dries and is ready for the next time . never felt so clean
647,this book , " the relatives came " by cynthia rylant and illustrated by stephen gammell , was a delight to read . i found myself smiling as i read the words that made the artwork come alive . likewise , i found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit . and , i felt as if i , too , were a part of this book . having experienced growing up in a small town where you don ` t see that many people , i believe that when relatives come to visit , it almost seems like christmas . as a result , when the book expressed the joy , laughter , and celebration of family , it stirred up these memories of the past . unquestionably , almost anyone , from children to adults , could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit .
648,this product could put user / customer 's life at risk . the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road . this is the worst product that i have used in my life .
649,after a few months of debating whether or not i needed the extra light for my work space i made the great choice of purchasing the happylite . i 've been using it the past few weeks and have really enjoyed how it brightens up the dark corner better than a regular lamp . now my only concern is how to order an extra bulb... . ( guess i should read the materials it came with ) .
650,as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well , this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises . it 's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears , having first been written in 1856. but it is practical , clear and encouraging . it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw . and by focussing on drawing with pencil , it provides the foundation for using any other media . a wonderful find
651,the vista set up is nice but is buggy and incompatible with a lot of games and upgrades
652,the performance given by poitier will not dissappoint . this movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother , lena . this work is timeless
653,first off , for people who are complaining about installing windows 2000 , it only took my approx . 6 1 / 2 hours ! i love it because every time i launch internet explorer it freezes ! i also love that theres 42 spyware programs and 78 tojans on my harddrive before i even hooked up my internet . the one thing i love the most though is that i can download any movie i want . like the recently video game adapted film mortal kombat ! it was at full quality on my 28.8k modem and it took about 3 minutes . the blue sceen of death happens so often i just went ahead and set it as my desktop and my screensaver . i also bought the separate ctrl alt del accesory pad , ive had it for about 2 days and i cant even tell what key is what anymore because i 've used it so much . but all in all dos has been a blessing , and i hope everyone embraces windows 95 into their homes . - shanan
654,fuji fails to honor warrantee - do n't buy from them do not buy the fuji digital camera . they charged me $[...] for a fix within the warrantee period . their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears . rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee . [...
655,i watched this movie and it sucked , very slow.it might be a renter not a owner
656,this might be the greatest mapping program in existance , but i would never know . very user unfriendly . there is no instruction book provided with it ( or available that i can find . ) the help function is very poor and does n't provide adequate instructions . if you just need basic mapping functions save your money and use one of the free online websites
657,the firm ( a conglomerate consisting of nas , az , foxy brown and the relative unknown nature ( who took the place of original member cormega after a heated dispute ) ) ...came up with the " brilliant idea " to collaborate on a full album...after the release of " affirmative action " from nas ' it was written album . after enlisting the assistance of dr. dre 's aftermath records and production by the infamous trackmasters , the firm 's album is subpar to say the least...it sounds like each individual artists is trying too hard to outshine the other and many of the beats consisting on this album are just a lil too sample heavy... . " hardcore " for example . however , i will admit , there are some shining moments by all four members....and some half decent production....i.e . " phone tap " ... " f**k somebody else " ( lyrics are forgettable since foxy is doing what she does best on the mic...talking about sex and its many forms....i think you might be able to masterbate to this one...lol ) . i will give this a decent try but i ca n't go no further than that . i will agree with one reviewer saying that listening to the group as solo artists is a more satisfying
658,i love this album , the best of phil collins . i believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut . i know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times / suffering with his ex wife . he did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well . he is a great composer . too bad most of his new songs...2006 , times are different and so is his life , i do not enjoy them as much . once an artist becomes more self-actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory .
659,i was very disappointed in this software . it 's not really good for anything and i still have n't figure out why this was even released . i own printmaster 15 , american greetings creata card 8 , and an few other photo and scrapbook programs . this software has templates to make banners , cards , invitations , and all that stuff . the templates are few compared to other programs and then to customize them , well you really can't . if you try to start out with a blank template and add your own photos you are limited to what you can do . no borders , edging , font manipulating . it 's just insert the photo , do some basic photo touch ups and that is pretty much it . i wanted to add shadows , edges , frames to my pictures and couldn't . the fonts could only be made in single color . you could not add outlines or drop shadows , nothing . add the font , pick your size , pick your style , and that was it . you can only save to their 1 file format which of course only works with zoom . no e-mailing or file converting . what good is this program i have yet to find out . i spend time to make a birthday invitation from my own pictures . well guess what , i could n't e-mail it to my guests . print is all it does . complete waste of money . this is the first software i ever purchased that i will be returning . spend a few extra bucks and get something like print master , print shop , or something comparible
660,if you 've read the book this movies is extremely loosely based on , you will understand why the movie is so horrid . it 's beautiful to look at , but that is all . the sets and costumes are gorgeous , but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a queen of france . this movie completely ignores the revolution , marie antoinette 's arrest , and murder . in short , the movie ignores anything that is not pretty , girlish , and light . there is so much fluff and teen angst that it 's hard to locate any fact in the film at all . do we really need a 10 close-up of kristen dunst wistfully lazing about her apartments after she meets a handsome man ? even one scene like this is bad enough , but it happens over and over . we see kids at play more than adults with real problems , and the actors and soundtrack only reinforce this feeling . there is shopping , food , dress up , and flirting , but minus a handful of very short scenes , no real account of the lives of the king and queen of france . there was little in the way of dialog , and sadly much of what there was was murmured while dunst flounced around in her pretty dresses . there is so much historical inaccuracy in the film that it 's almost pointless to try to listen to the dialog . for instance , the dauphin and 2 brothers , which we are told in the book the film is " based " on . however , in the film , the brothers are combined into one , very inaccurate character . marie antoinette also had 2 sons , not one as the movie will tell you . i do n't mind some changes for the sake of drama , but ignoring 90% of a historical account and then insisting that your movie is factual is ridiculous . the main actors are also terrible . the supporting cast , such as rip torn , and marriane faithful , is wonderful . they only serve to make kirsten dunst look that much worse . no one bother to act french , or like the poised rulers-in-training that their character were . the movie is so obviously a veichle for dunst that it 's sickening . there is just too much of her on the screen with not nearly enough reason for her to be there . remember the 10 minute scene i described where she does nothing but smile ? it keeps happening . it gets very , very old . it feels more like a photo shoot for dunst than a film . i usually like kirsten dunst , but not in this film . overall , the film looks and feels more like a music video and should have been one . there just is n't enough going on to warrent the film 's length , and it 's really geared towards young girls who love pretty dresses , food , and shopping , but have no taste for fact . it 's a chick flick at it 's worst , and it makes a mockery of the life of such an important person . it 's very hard to believe that this came from the same person who wrote and directed films like " the virgin suicides " and " lost in translation "
661,if you are looking for a dvd that is filled with white stripes music and interviews , look elsewhere . the item description says it has over 40 minutes of in-depth interviews , but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes ( if that ) of this is actually with the band ( and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd ) . it has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the white stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning . it is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details , but it is not something i will watch again . ( if jack & meg were telling their own story , that would be worth it )
662,excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives . you can format , partition , split , merge and a whole lot of other things . if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software . with both , you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c: \ drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another . this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup . ( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive . ) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages
663,i 've tried a lot of different " nutrition " and " energy " bars , and these are my favorites ( along with a couple of other chocolate zoneperfect bars like double chocolate and chocolate raspberry ) . great taste , a nice texture ( sort of like nestle crunch ) , and much more satisfying than candy bars . almost as tasty as girl scout " thin mints " , but not as fat - and guilt-inducing
664,my hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing / smoothing products - - they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth . my hair is very fine , but also thick ( which is very annoying ) . this finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down . it seems very expensive for such a small bottle , but a little goes a long way ( i 've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it 's still not finished ) . definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all . the scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming .
665,not sure how i got it , but i got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot would n't get rid of . on top of that i got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus would n't get rid of . so out of desperation to do something quickly , i went to b.buy and bought this for $40. they did n't have a large selection , so i put down the money for it . imagine my feeling when i saw it on amazon for $20. still this product works well . it made me uninstall spybot , adaware , and turn off my windows firewall to install it . you can install it on 3 different computers , or it asked you to switch your license from one of them , should you install it a fourth time . so you can install it more than 3 times , you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand ? product works very well and got rid of my problems . you get updates for 1 year , and then you have to renew . i think this is stupid personally , but its the trend now days . its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year . several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what i want it to do . i wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it . the firewall slows down your connection , but they all do . i have 3mg dsl and my speed test are down around 1300k , so i 've lost alot of bandwith . i guess its worth the protection . before with spybot and adaware , the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware . now with trend micro , i find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan . so i 'm happy with the product , except for my decrease in dsl speed
666,i am a 20 year user of several remington products , but i must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver . the remington es-1000 utra smooth bump control shaver was designed to replace the original ( bms ) black man 's shaver which was discountinued several years ago . i recently purchased and used the es-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance . the es-1000 performed so poorly that i had to use my bms that i had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the es-1000 shaver could not and did not remove . the product should be called " ultra poor with a sandpaper finish . " the product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet . for anyone with curly hair problems , you may want to consider comparing this product against the wahl 5-star series , model # 8061. i think you will find there is a major difference in the products
667,great book ; it get 's you thinking . my kids arre almost out of the nest and they are all i could ask for . yes , i worked . but not until they were in school , almost always part time and i did not use ' working ' as an excuse to not volunteer at school , sports , and generally be in my kids lives . the point is really about your priorities . do you instinctively put your kids needs first ? it 's been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area . we have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten ; now they are seniors . you can instantly tell which parents were connected , involved and had their priorities straight . not all of them stayed home the whole time . on and off i used to listen to dr. laura , frequently agreeing , but many times not . what i love is that she has an unpopular point of view and she 's not going to let social , financial , or industry pressure dilute her message . yes , she 's frequently abrasive ; so were many people who have made an impact in the course of events in this world . if you are a parent with young children read the book at least it will give you important ideas to agree or disagree with .
668,having read some of the reviews here i just thought i should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band ! while the singer ( conor oberst ) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands , he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout ( unlike a band like taking back sunday ) the music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental , the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punk-politics band and do n't come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit . if you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to bright eyes , if you want to do something about it listen to desaparecidos
669,we have used scansoft / nuance products for over five years - as a matter of fact i am writing this review using dragon 8. omnipage pro 15 along with the pdf converter is by far the best on the market . the technical support has been fantastic throughout the years and the engineers always had open ears for recommended changes . omnipage pro 15 has saved me thousands of dollars because of its unbelievable ocr accuracy . with a click and a choice i can now convert a pdf document into xl as spreadsheet . before this technology was created it was such a hassle . when i have to fill out a form omnipage pro 15 uses the saved information to help me . the program can run in the background and does not freeze or slow down my system . edward lampl president of healthcare recruitment stuart search group
670,being a flight attendant myself and looking through the skymall magazine countless times on long flights i can tell you...this book is amazing . i have never laughed so hard from a book all my life . i really want to get another one and put it in the crew lounge . i 'm sure the flight crews will get a kick out of it :
671,this is not a review of this item , but the whole series . not only are the films in this bundle not all musicals , this bundle is sent intstead of the purchased bundle . until amazon straightens out the mess in titles , forget ordering alice faye and betty grable bundles : particularly marquee musicals .
672,wow , did someone slip the wrong cd into my jewelbox or what ? if you 're a fan of allison 's other work , epect nothing like what you 've heard before . this is mostly a pop album , and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering . the sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding . even allisons voice has no drive to it . steve earl is no match on the guitar for joe mcmahan who played on the show cd / dvd .
673,to cover all the problems with continuity , logic , theology , geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book . one hardly knows where to start . perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel . as such , it is n't even a decent trashy novel ; instead of steamy sex scenes , we get sanctimonious sermonizing . worse than that , what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book , ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it 's too late . the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized . even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario ( an idea with virtually no scriptural support ) , little in the characters ' actions , thought processes or dialog rings true . one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student . god ends up looking like the ultimate villain , demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else . whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear ? who is the present-day equivalent of c . s . lewis , or catherine marshall , and why are n't they getting more attention ? these were writers who actually made you think . lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing ; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought . they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask . one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all , or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter . these days , it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson , whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted , bigoted caricature of what it once was . perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured . if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers , then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind
674,i wish the ones with lex barker would become available . i think lex was the best looking tarzan although johnny was still good . a good watch although i say again lex is better
675,this dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of christianity ; it discusses an alternate viewpoint ( as dan brown reminds us " the winners write the history books " ) this dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with ; esp . the idea of god as male , and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership . this dvd includes interviews with dan burstein , henry lincoln , martin lunn , lynn picknett , clive prince , dr. karen ralls , dr. james robinson , and margaret starbird . i particularly liked margaret starbird 's interviews - she describes how when she first read " holy blood , holy grail " , she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal catholic . but afterward , she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research mary magdalene and write " the woman with the alabaster jar " . she comes across as very rational , sensible and even heroic . it takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority . i thought dan burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of jewish people during the time jesus lived . i think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that does n't mean it is necessarily the truth . to be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live
676,i bought two one time , but there was no vedio on lcd as opened for both ! they could not recorded vedio but audio only . it seemed that they had n't ccd at all ! i had to mail them back to repare just the day i got them , and the jvc even would not cover the charge
677,this is a most beautiful movie . i can ` t imagine anyone not enjoying it . the two disc package is brilliant and i will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after i have gone
678,registry mechanic by pc tools is an absolute must for managing one of the gray areas of windows . easy to use . immediate boost in speed . great price . a " must have " . 5 stars . fdr
679,i have used this blood pressure monitor almost every day for weeks and it works great . it 's an excellent value and i would recommend it to my friends without reservation
680,moral consciousness and communicative action is the primary anglophone source for habermas 's writings on & quot ; discourse ethics . &quot ; written in the early eighties , this translation , which was published in 1990 , provides a developmental perspective . the focus of the essays moves from habermas 's statements about the role of philosophy today , in & quot ; philosophy as stand-in and interpeter , to his writing on reconstructive social science in general , to his program for a discourse ethics in particular . the final papers address criticisms of this program . the volume suffers a bit from the fact that thomas mccarthy 's introduction is keen to locate habermas 's position vis a vis various contemporary moral-philosophical standpoints , but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the broader canvas of habermas 's overarching social-theoretic project
681,h&r block does a much better job marketing software than writing it . i used the on-line version , had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later . after about an hour of painfully slow entry , sometimes just one item per page , most of the time looking at " loading , please wait " i had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save . no luck , repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error , and i could not save without registering . finally just left the computer on and left ; when i came back taxcut had timed out and lost all my data . by the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies . even if you select no you will get frequent e-mails from h&r block . i will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year . when a company ca n't get something simple like this right , it calls into question everything they do
682,hi folks , the movies all look very good..and there are a nice group of bonus features from vintage featurettes to commentaries ! on macao...i particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with jane russell and robert mitchum that robert osborne conducted...very late in the life of mr mitchum . the packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great robert mitchum at under $10 each on dvd w / bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal ! the movies are n't generally considered mitchum 's best or best known but when you consider you 've got jean simmons as a costar and otto preminger directing angel face , josef von sternberg helming macao , vincent minnelli directing home from the hill , the great fred zinneman directing and the legend deborah kerr co-starring in the sundowners ...you can figure this is n't the bottom of the barrel either ! oh and sydney pollack directed the yakuza and contributes a great commentary... . to sum up...warner bros...continues to deliver the very best classic titles on dvd with the best combination of quality transfers / bonus features and value packages ! ! ! !
683,what i wanted for christmas was something to turn my bath tub into a whirlpool , and my boyfriend bought this for me . the bubbles are no doubt amazing , they 're plenty strong even at the lowest setting . as for the massage part , i did n't use that too much - it just vibrates some , and the bubbles seemed to be more massaging than the vibrating massager . the only thing i did not really care for is that it was kind of difficult to keep on the tub floor . it has suction cups , but they did n't work too well - everytime i moved my feet or legs , it wanted to float to the top of the water . overall , i 'd say this is a pretty good gift ! i will definitely use it many more times
684,i have been using pc-cillin after dumping mcafee following some lousy customer support with no issues . this new version i was very concerned after reading all of the reviews . it does seem to slow things a little on my amd pc if i am running all of the options i can run but even with them it is tolerable . i am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple .
685,before you buy , be sure to check where the pen was made . i have a number of older cross pens that say " usa " near the top , and they are great pens . however , i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made , and they are of inferior quality . the top and bottom halves are loose , and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap . the first one i got , i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a " handling fee " attached . i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly , one bad pen . so later on when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect . my advice : if you want a good cross pen , go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa . they are n't making them the same anymore .
686,i was very happy with the previous model dsc-n1 , which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting . but this one , while i only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather , it really disappointed me . the pictures are always blured due to too much exposure , i used auto flash , for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1mp ! i 'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible i will return it , i just ca n't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes . i doubt i was unlucky and got a bad one , i ca n't believe a 10.1mp sony camera takes so poor pictures . and after reading the previous review about the terrible sony custmer servce , i decide i will avoid sony customer service , and the camera will just be returned . note : found the review by cecelia choy " cece " on march 13 , 2007 mentioned the same problem i had . i did n't have this problem with my previous model dsc-n1. april 17 , 2006 : i bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now ! suggestion for those having the same problem i had before - - exchange for another one ! !
687,i got the dreaded " e18 " error after owning this ( naturally ) for just over a year . repairs will be at least $100 , and repairs are only guaranteed for 90 days...even if the exact same problem occurs again ! this is clearly a design flaw ( just read how many users had the same problem ) . my first photoshot broke after about a year and a half , and since i liked the ease of use and basic design , i chalked it up to bad luck and bought another . big mistake
688,i highly recommend microsoft digitial image suite 10 and the free gimp programs for all of your digital imaging needs ! ! ! ( ... ) dis 10 should be out now. .
689,they sent me a product that was n't legit and would n't take it back . horrible service & i do n't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor ! just a horrible waste of time & money
690,i have always been a prolific reader and rarely do i come across a book for which i can find no value , no redeeming qualities . but i must extend a hearty congratulations to julia barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement i have ever had the misfourtune to purchace . teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense . if you are like me and just have to read it - just because you 're obsessed with austen - buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it
691,this is a wonderful lens with great image quality , very fast , and very good build quality . no complaints
692,this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes . we purchased it for a cruise , because we wanted to carry-on the camcorder and have it protected , but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories . this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras
693,ashlee 's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that 's she 's all plastic and no talent . she must of asked the dr to make her look like her sister . very sad cause she 's unrecognizable now . better looking , maybe , still ca n't sing or dance .
694,i bought this for my boyfriend . i needed something affordable , and this was it . the bubble machine is quiet , and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time . the only complaint i have are the warnings it has . it just gets me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if i make a mistake . well other than that , this product is good . i 've had it for i think a couple of months now , and nothing awful has happened and it 's still working fine . :
695,i like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model . the kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth . it 's a bit louder than the older model , probably because it 's got an additional motion , and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light . overall , just what we wanted
696,what a wonderful book . it 's too bad so many readers today know only tom wolfe , not thomas wolfe . even though it has been at least 10 years since reading look homewood angel , i knew almost immediately when i came to the new sections . they add a depth to the novel , bringing in the whole town and relatives , rather being only about eugene gant . my favorite wolfe readings involve trains ; the experience about time stopping for a moment when you look into the eyes of someone looking directly at you into the train , is exactly as i remember my earlier train rides.what are they doing now , that the train has passed ? other 800 page books might be dull , but not this one . having been given it as a present recently , i am very surprised and disappointed that it is already ' out of print . &quot ; more people should know about o lost
697,great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity . though edited by bob blaisdell , who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions , the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day . their messages speak for themselves . a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections . one is their brevity . the speakers get to the point and make it clearly . few inclusions run longer than five pages . there is also a level of genuine ( and often sad ) honesty . many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians ' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation , if such a thing was possible at the time . the tone is often one of resignation , but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners . it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not , but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed , rightly or wrongly , the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat . even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts . the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical , though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own . one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english . nonetheless , the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people , separated by years , language , and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners
698,i love this battery charger ! i used to use store bought aa batteries for my olympus digital camera , but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week , the batteries were drained of power . for some reason , this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if i am just storing my camera . highly recommended
699,as a frequent reader of home design books and magazines , the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me . a quick review of the table of contents revealed that i had to have this book . pelosi begins with the basics , moves into specifics , and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune . the pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor . whether you are looking for a single design solution or , like me , enjoy reading about interior design , this is the book for you...and it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home . " interior divine " made my holiday shopping easier this year !
700,usually jerry 's scores for movies are priceless , ( i.e. the other score for & quot ; legend&quot ; ) but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too&quot ; forced&quot ; for my taste.it 's ok as a weird sort of comedy album , i suppose , but from the main theme i was laughing because it 's meant to be such a serious experience-but is n't ! i think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd . ( .
701,i recently purchased this camera and i 'm loving it . as a whole it 's very easy to use and carry . i 'm a college student going into photograpy and this is a great starter camera . i have a feeling this one is going to be with me for a very long time
702,i 'll start with the positive : the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall , good-looking , smart , humble , etc. the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow , carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words . in short , it was a competent work of fiction . that 's where my praise ends , because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas . sure , it 's a work of fiction , no one is going to take it seriously , yada yada yada . but that 's not true , is it ? so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers . alright , here are my problems with it : first , politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power , but that 's not true if you 're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state . in term limits , vince flynn just beats you over the head with the " power corrupts " mantra - he does n't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song , yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist . you know what , though ? there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what 's right , who really are trying to make a difference for the positive , for this nation and the citizens . in this book , however , the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they are n't smart enough to make good decisions . second , murder is a viable answer . this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land . come on , get real . this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he does n't balance the budget . and , they get away with it because it 's really the right side to be on . murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn . murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation , that being elections . elections apparently just get in the way . third , the balanced budget . for years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget . the book makes it the central theme . balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible . it 's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel . a coup ! ! ! yet , when the conservatives did take power , despite vince flynn 's prescient forecasting ability , they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and did n't flinch . even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility , they claim that now ! ! ! ! ! the deficit is n't a big deal , that it 's really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it . this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90 's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later . it 's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits . fourth , the good guys do n't do bad things . the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians . the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool . flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous , though shalt not ? - cv ric
703,i 've been a robben ford fan since 1979. each time he offers a new recording , i try to purchase it as quickly as possible . robben can rock and play slow blues . every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again . i ca n't say enough ! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation ! if you like robben ford , do n't miss chris cain . this man is also a guitar genius
704,the razor and trimmer are both easy to use and give a nice clean shave . i am very happy with this item
705,we use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations . the hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations . to test the microphone . i went to a noisy starbucks , huge lines , moderate music and tons of conversations . i recorded on the video cameras mics , then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature . i aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders . in all instances , there was no difference in sound quality . i then went to the sony style store in the mall and had her open a different microphone and allowed her to install it . she read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings . we could not find any difference . i checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic . once the mic is attached and turned on , the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic . i am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera . many of the new camcorders with hard drives and dvd drives do not have a mic input or active interface shoe . i would rather want a mic input so that i can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of sony to create one for their shoe . overall , i am stuck . if i record something interesting i will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing . ( the camera shots great video
706,i really do n't know how to write a " helpful " review for this camera , i 'm not a photographer ; all i can say is that i was not satisfied with my purchase , so.. . *** if you 're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get ( like i was a few months ago ) , save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras . *** here are my complaints : flash is too strong ( blinding , in fact ) . please do not take this complaint lightly , the flash is brighter than you think ( it actually hurts , i 'm talking physical pain here ) . i actually fear it might have some long term effects , this alone is a deal-breaker for me ! it 's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at nikon . sure , you can turn the flash off . but that only brings me to my other major complaint ! the lighting must be almost perfect if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash . the lens do not respond well to artificial lighting , at all , pictures either come out all grainy ( if it 's slightly dark ) or with huge white patches all over if there 's a lot of light in the background . even when the lighting is almost perfect , you lose a lot of quality ( even when using the highest settings , 6mp ) . the scene modes did n't help much , i tried everything , all the different modes offer so little difference , very gimicky in my opinion . even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash , there 's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear , why ? i have no clue what so ever . i might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a slightly different pose ( but still stable ) , and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear ! must admit though , the swivel design is very practical and makes things so much easier . the video mode is great as well . if you do n't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash , then i must admit , the pictures do come out nicely . ( most of the time
707,having a study bible on my palm pilot has been very helpful . whenever i had some down time i always wished i had my bible . now i do at all times . it is easy to navigate . takes up a good amount of memory so just be prepared , but if you have enough memory on a card in your palm , it works great . i have used the memorize help feature a lot as well for memorizing verses . great product !
708,american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree . i read the human stain a few years ago , and it was good . but , in pastoral , the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst , and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst , but absent the psychoanalyst : roth is our psychoanalyst . what he misses , however , is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control . the swede never failed as a father ; rather , he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
709,item was received in perfect shape . it is a wonderful item and a great buy
710,hank chinaski ca n't hold a job , ca n't hold a woman , ca n't control his alcoholism , and ca n't make a decent friend because he wallows with the dregs of society . chinaski is the lowest of the semi-functioning drunks , barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor . unfortunately , the movie does n't hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people . chinaski 's struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into . there 's no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism . the closest he comes to poetics , imho , is where he tells his ex-boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk . ' factotum ' is saved only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn matt dillon ( hank ) , lili taylor ( jan ) , and marisa tormei ( laura ) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene . the script is stilted , without any highs or lows to it . the movie is n't near as fatalistic as ' leaving las vegas ' , or as hard hitting as ' requiem for a dream ' , and without any of the comedic relief from ' spun' . the closest comparison would be the jaw-stretching yawn-fest of ' drunks' . even if you love addiction movies like i do , or love dillon or tormei , that still is n't enough to recommend this movie . if curiosity overcomes you as it did me , then rent the movie before buying it . it 's earned two stars for the acting alone . have a ball or something else to play with if you rent this , it 's that boring .
711,this camera is the best point and shoot cameras for the money . just think of what you are getting . not just a 7.2mp camera , but a lica lens and technology . not a bad deal . the images are not bad when printed . on a scale of 0-10 , 10 beining the best , i give this camera an 8. david the photog in chicago
712,this review is for turbo tax basic for mac / pc 2005 the software is easy enough to use but either out of curiosity or self abuse , i checked the results manually and found a round off flaw contained in the program . if you are self employed and use form se ( self employment tax form ) the program fails to round " up " correctly . the mistake favors the individual and not the feds . this is a math error and the irs can red flag it . i remember several years ago i purchased the deluxe or premire verson and the program recommended that i might consider putting $300 into my ira in order to lower my tax bracket , it was great ! however subsquent versions did not do this , after which i only purchase the basic version .
713,if you have never heard book of shadows by zakk wylde , then you may be suprised by this album . the two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar , and although i 'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion , hm vi contains more . for example , take ' she deserves a free ride ' and the ballad ' fear' . the piano on this album is superb , haunting at one point and almost relaxing at another . however , there is just enough of past ' metal ' bls in this album - ' crazy or high ' and ' house of doom' . personal favourites are ' damage is done ' , ' layne ' and ' queen of sorrow' . there is something more in the solo 's - they come in at just the right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out ' stepping stone ' for an example . the musicianship has got even better on this album , with the dodgy drums on 1919 eternal gone , and the bass that was pushed to the background in the blessed hellride is up there with zakk 's playing . this album is deep , moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering blessed hellride . ca n't wait for the new mafia cd to be released .
714,wow ! this movie is deeply entrenched on my list of worst movies of all time . i watched it last night and i woke up in a bad mood . everything about it sucked except for the nudity ( hence the single star ) . i understand it was supposed to be something of a " comedy " , but without a touch of reality , i found myself laughing at the movie instead of with it . the acting is awful , the soundtrack is hideous and the plot is a joke . michael caine 's goofy appearance was accentuated with some ginormous glasses.. . there is n't a teen girl alive who would find that " sexy " . when i saw the ' blame it on rio ' reviews on this site , i felt the urge to hunt down every person who gave it more than 2 stars ( many gave it 5 ! ! ) , strangle them , then watch as they emptied the contents of their bowels all over the floor .
715,i have used turbo tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it . this year however some " genius " decided to change the entire format and approach and i found this year 's version to be terrible . very confusing now when used to be clear and simple . hard to even download , confusing up dates , difficult to find numerous frequently used items ( estimated taxes paid in previous year , capital gains / losses , state taxes paid , and more ) . the running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed . i have zero confidence in this year 's program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years . have recommended turbo tax to many over the years , but would strongly recommend against buying this year 's product . a perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it . suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software , this one stinks
716,i loved this album . strangely enough i was introduced to the title song by gray 's anatomy where i just had to find out who was singing that lead ( alice russell ) . the rest of the album is like the r& b music i grew up with . definitely worth a listen
717,i first encountered bird3 opening for veruca salt the summer of 2001. that band had put their faith into bird and so have i . we fell in love with them all together . this band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique , beautiful , and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today . you 'll find yourself not only humming along , but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments . you will not once regret buying this piece of art
718,the " original " glide was made by ( or used ) gore tex material . the photo for this product showed the logo for gore tex . the product shipped was the product now marketed by crest ; no mention of gore tex . the crest product is vastly inferior to the " original " gore tex
719,i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist - up - and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
720,accurate scale - records use of two different users plus guests ( or your chlidren ! ) remembers prior info . body fat % is a great and fairly accurate feature . these combined features make it worth the cost . plan on reading the manual to set up
721,fall through spring i always carry my r817 in coat pocket when i go out . this jacket fits my camera like a glove . allows access to all controls and lcd display through clear , heavy duty plastic film , once flap is opened . open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera . only time i zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery , otherwise , i just leave jacket on camera at all times .
722,i purchased this dryer because of the shape and attachments and wanted to try an ionic dryer . first of all , if this is an ionic dryer i was better off with my super cheap dryer . second , the back seam of the dryer melted ! ! several people have mentioned that it overheats and they are not lying . it shuts off and refuses to come back on . which is good because then it might melt completely . do n't waste your money on this
723,nothing in this book was usable for me . okay , very little . if i was trying to write the next _ethan frome_ , then this book would be perfect . instead i write sci-fi and fantasy . i was looking for tips to improve my description of things ; this book recommends describing different things . too much emphasis on metaphor ( which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious ) . if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate , this book might be a waste of your time . however , poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than i did
724,ordered this item on sept 28. they were supposed to ship it within 1 week . after 1 week i received an email , they said they needed 2 more weeks . another email today ( nov 7 ) , they think they can deliver it by november 27. that 's 2 months after i placed my order . at this point , i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year . fortunately with amazon , they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order , which is what i am going to do right now
725,for those not aware , pumpkinhead 2 is ( supposedly ) the 1994 sequel to 1988 's timeless monster classic , pumpkinhead . the original was darkly creepy , superbly constructed in it 's story , and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature . pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific , butchers the story , and basically uses the name and a simliar creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant " sequel " . it 's like a group of writers saw a picture of pumpkinhead on the internet , read his name ( and that 's all they read ) , and decided to make their own movie . as for the plot ( if anyone cares ) , a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings . i 'll admit , if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie , this would 've been worth two or three stars as a " so bad it 's good " b flick . but the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it . if you have n't seen 1988 's pumpkinhead , rent it or buy it - - it 's a horror masterpiece ( especially compared to this ) with so much going for it . but avoid this sequel at all costs . i hate to put down any product , but i feel that this one deserves it
726,do n't buy this . " from the grave " is overdubbed b / w film without bruce lee in it . the other two are n't great either
727,david fromkin 's " peace to end all peace " is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work . many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other . fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east ( extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia ) was created during and after the first world war . obviously , in order to do this , the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered . this is where fromkin 's unusual methodology comes into play . focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the " eastern question " in their favour , the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process . admittedly , it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn , but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire ( and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter ) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much . never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell . a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today , and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations . the problem that fromkin has , however , is that he does not make these very well at all . the story is told in a roughly chronological manner , which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters . ultimately , the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader , who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is . additionally , fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided . indeed , one map ( showing enver pasha 's advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia ) is laughable in the extreme . the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows , and not equilateral triagles . where fromkin does well , however , is in his use of purely european sources . it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east , but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question . in terms of europe , however , his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did . ultimately , " a peace to end all peace " is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work . a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this , and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been ( the chapters in margaret attwood 's " the peacemakers " or william cleveland 's " modern middle east " both easily outshine this )
728,i bought it new . after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower , it stopped working . i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop . braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior , including the electronics . they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me . i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower . i have not opened the shaver , i have not cleaned it in water . thus , based on my experience , this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned
729,mercifully , vh-1 has n't released the nauseating , moron-targeting ' i love the 90s ' dvd series ( yet ) , so you 'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion soundtrack disc . this is precisely the kind of cd which should n't even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the internet , legal or illegal . there 's no rhyme or reason to the collection , and the songs you might actually want to remember...you probably already downloaded them . the source show is easily one of the most appalling projects mtv / vh-1 has produced in some time . it 's basically a bunch of ' comedians ' and third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s ( or rather , the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996 , say ) with such fond memories and gusto , hoping the next generation ingests this poison with the understanding that mambo no . 5 was a ' good , memorable song ' for instance . avoid at all costs . take pleasure in denying tag team their royalties when you find their ' classic ' song on online...for free
730,bestseller -stupid plot -horrible plot -dumb characters i have one conculsion matthew reilly was trying to buy up all the copies of this book to save himself from embrassmen
731,the camera case only works if you wear a belt- - there is no clip on . the case itself holds only the camera , not even space for a spare battery or memory card . ( i 've heard the case will darken your camera , but i did n't end up using the case ) . the neck strap is not useful , it 's too long . at ' 34 inches , if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it . ( the canon camera rocks , however .
732,bread8 , that 's one of the stupidest comments i 've ever read . you do n't know s*** about metal . you ca n't handle the intensity of real metal because you 're a fat virgin who 'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like " immortal rites " and " pleasure to kill . " leave the metal to the metalheads you mallcore f@ggot . anyway , " dysfunction is better than staind 's other stuff , but only by a microscopic margin . aaron lewis is a weak , talentless crybaby whose bandmates could n't make a good song to save their lives . every song on here is full of bogus " pain " and " depression " coupled with abyssmal musicianship just like every other nu-metal band . if you want heavy music that 's accessible for the masses , go for rage against the machine ( except for " evil empire " ) , faith no more , helmet , living colour , and quicksand .
733,i ordered a case for my kodak dx6490 digital camera from antonline thru amazon but received a case that is inches too small for my camera . if the numbers referenced above show in the review , you can see that my model of camera does not appear . in spite of this antoline has refused to issue an rma for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if i return without their rma . they tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened . the only packaging was a brown padded envelope . is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it ? i guess i could go to the airport and put it through the screener . there is a little tag on the case that reads dx6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height , depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice . when i checked kodak online , the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions . amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either . at this point i would never patronize antoline again
734,take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same . really , is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids ? they deserve better . the key point of this movie is that lying is bad . good point . a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks . also good . unfortunately , the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible ( even kids will have a hard time believing a man ca n't tell he 's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror ) , and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion , the entire thing falls flat . making films for children is a fine thing . they should n't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children , however . quite honestly , i 'd rather have a kid watch something like " good will hunting " before this . do n't waste your children 's time with this film . read them a book ... a good book ... instead
735,this book consists of 29 stand-alone essays , beautifully written and previously published in the " new england journal of medicine " during the early seventies . from the first chapter : " the viruses , instead of being single-minded agents of disease and death , now begin to look more like mobile genes...we live in a dancing matrix of viruses ; they dart , rather like bees , from organism to organism , from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again , and into the sea , tugging along pieces of this genome , strings of genes from that , transplanting grafts of dna , passing around heredity as though at a great party . " although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter , there are consistent threads of thought as the author free associates : 1.there is a joyful attitude about science and discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living things . 2.there is constant reference to the interaction , symbiosis , and co-operative living arrangements amongst the different species . 3.there are numerous references to the mindless activities of ants , bees , and termites , whose activities create sophisticated , developed projects without any evidence of central control . these examples are repeatedly compared to humans and their social activities , with the human emphasis being on language . 4.the cell is the unit of life , complete with all its intricate inner workings . the cell membrane ( cell wall in plants ) is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible . in the first chapter and frequently throughout , the author wants to think of the earth as a kind of organism , but he ca n't make it work - too big , too complex , too many working parts without visible connections . then in the last chapter , a better analogy emerges . the earth is like a huge cell and the protective atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our cell membrane . this fine book is a precursor to books from the likes of carl sagan , richard feynman , and stephen jay gould . reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea - each one is only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to think about . amazingly , after 30 years , there is a little - but not much - in this book that is out of date . if you are a little rusty on biology , have your " oxford dictionary of science " handy . first class .
736,i owned this sony for a single day before i returned it to amazon . first off , it records in mpeg2 format which is fairly compressed , and looks it once you upload to your computer . it is also not natively supported on the mac without a 20$ additional quicktime mpeg2 plugin . which has to be converted before editing . which makes it a slow , tedious affair . also , the included software is , surprise , pc only . other problems , not computer related - the chroma shift in " night mode " is intense , making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly . i 'm not expectant of miracles in night modes , but it seems like a simple solution on the production side ( sony ) . the auto white balance could also use the same attention . like the previous reviewer pointed out , not a bad camera for the money if you 're not serious about editing and you 're using a pc . the lcd touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use . all in all , i would go for a canon
737,bought the massager - overall ok but it is heavy to use with one hand , after sometime it gets to you . it has a good vibration capability better than the others i had . could have a better handle and a longer cord . how about making them 110 - 240v then i can travel with it
738,my boss asked me to get this , so that he check out the latin portion of it . what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is *latin* american spanish . the interface was underwhelming . i needed to guess at what did what , because the controls are mostly icons . what 's worse , there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program . apparently though , the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back . if you are learning the differences between us and uk english , its there ! i gave this one star , only because i could n't give it no stars
739,why ? because it has good sound dts hd 5.1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim
740,i really like the crane humidifiers for children , my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time . it occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet . so i was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good . i was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than i had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different . still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it did n't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off . this may be a fault with the one i received and so i have sent it back , or it may be a design flaw with this shape . i have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere . so although i have n't had chance to use it i am more hopeful of success . it is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them , i forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time
741,look , the fact is feminism is about choice no more , no less . i have the highest respect for stay at home moms- -it is the hardest darn job on earth . but this woman is way off base to say that feminism sold us a lie . feminism gave us a choice . it told us we did not have to pretend to believe we were june cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls . personally , i could not have children and only feminists have not made me feel like an alien species . i work with troubled teens , my skills do not go to waste , i spoil my nieces and nephews- -i am fulfilled and happy . my sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys , she is fulfilled and happy , feminism gave us those choices , ladies . we were not " sold " anything , we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us . if you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world 's most important job , i think that is your issue and not now's . stop blaming feminism for your insecurities , if you are feminist- -stop blaming your mother for your insecurities- -you have choices because of feminism not despite it !
742,i do n't even own this cd , and after seeing the reviews i do n't want it . 90% of the " 5 star " reviews are people with only one review . suspicious ? ? look for yourself , it 's right there to see . i have some other meditation cds that are very repetitive , i 'm not going to make the same mistake here , especially with such shameless self-promotion
743,its a great gps once its starts and detects the satellites ( sometimes it can take up to 5 mins ) . i used it with iguidance and that software is the whole world of difference . i can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the gps unit ( robotic sounds , need to subtitle that for me please ! )
744,wow , how nice to watch sam cooke 's story from beginning to end . interviews with the family adds a wealth of inside information . i never knew sam 's father was a chicago minister and of course sam was the younger one who surprised the family when he first sang ! unfortunate for music that his life was taken so early . after watching this dvd , i bought sam cooke music and surpised that some songs are songs i had no idea sam wrote
745,i read the various reviews about the movie " the hunter " . i was surprised at the extremeties in preference . much like owning a fiero , . . . . which i do . the movie , as is the fiero , is overall slower than most of mcqueen's . however , he still pulls it off , showing his great acting ability . when you take the character , " papa " thorson , he was a different breed in the wrong time era . who else , but mcqueen could make him so realistic ? i have n't seen the movie in several years . i have been wanting a copy to add to my library . i intend to do that today . oh yeah , the relationship between the movie and the fiero ? i have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it . i loved " the hunter " and i love my fiero . for those of you who do n't understand , . . . " sorry " ! steve mcquen displayed more of his talent , even while ill . god bless you , steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us
746,intuit charges banks extra to support mac users , and many banks do n't pay . so the convenience of automated transaction downloads is impossible for me on quicken mac . several other features are lagging behind the windows version . and for some inexplicable reason , transferring data between quicken for windows and quicken for mac is n't complete or straightfoward . i have n't used competing products , but for mac users i recommend either running the windows quicken version ( using boot camp or parallels ) or buying another product . and by all means , let intuit know that their pricing practices are costing them customers
747,i bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends . i have had if for more than one year , and it has performed above expectations under all conditions . the 1 minute video feature is great , and was an unexpected bonus ( since i did n't know about it when i bought it off amazon ) . the camera works great with iphoto and macos x . i bought a 512 mb card for it and so far it has been great . both my father and my father in law have the previous powershot s400 and they have had no problems with it . i figure at some point i 'll have to change the battery , because lithium-ions lose 20% capacity per year , but so far it has worked flawlessly .
748,i have watched arthurs perfect christmas a couple of times on tv . i live in australia and no arthur d.v.ds not realy any videos either have come out . so could you please bring some out to australia . this is a must see for any arthur or non arthur fan ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
749,i have moderate knowledge of computers , etc. and i found this overly complicated . this is not intended for the novice . however , even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money . i wish i had not bought it at all . perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of...but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them . save your money...this was a waste
750,i got the hang on the 21% and all they could tell me at tech support is to shut down extra services . well the only services i had running was the security services ( firewall and antivirus ) . as an experiment i tried loading it on two computers set up identically . on one i shut down the antivirus and on the other i shut down the firewall . neither would install . so i shut down both on both computers and it installed perfectly on both . i cant believe that they want you to shut down security in order to install . makes me wonder. . " what are they hiding that they dont want me to know about " . i checked adaware and a registry cleaner and even ran my av again and found nothing but still.. . it makes you wonder . also the layout is very poor , so buggy they have many , many patches and updates . will not print forms correctly and want to charge you fees to e-file when it is free from the governments . they just want more money . in my opinion...do not waste your money on this crap . by the time you waste your money on getting this to work , you can get a professional to do it for you for less
751,the print looks like you 're watching it through muddy water ; is this something to do with the unclear " public domain " status of this and other of capra 's works ? does n't he have a family that could help out his dvds the way that chaplin 's family has done , or even , to use the opposite extreme , the family of edgar ulmer , who have released superlative versions of some pretty dicey movies ? the point is that if people are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice , and all the various dvds of meet john doe are painful to watch . we 've heard for years of the re-worked ending of the film , and that another one exists ( or existed at one time ) . bring it on ! for now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching gary cooper react to barbara stanwyck 's pure life . it 's sort of like ball of fire but a bit more subtle . moviemakers knew they were on to agood thing teaming the two , because cooper 's slow-moving , nearly snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when placed next to stanwyck 's vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear gaze and complexion . she does n't even have to speak , she emanates something very basic in her bones and her posture . okay , the movie writes itself into a corner , for what else is going to happen except that if gary cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it 's established with the viewers . this has always been doe 's problem , that it has to cheat to come out ahead of itself , and it did n't work in 1943 and it still is n't working now . it 's great up until about an hour and fifteen minutes ; then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as " hollywood " tries to solve a basically philosophical dilemma
752,david foster , who wrote a few tunes on yes 's " time and a word " is here on bass with tony kaye on the b3 and it 's the performance of their lives captured live at the rainbow . a brave but good way to record a debut album , album was produced by jon anderson and the cover drawn by roger dean , just like yes . it gives you feeling that tony left yes on good terms when rick wakeman stepped in
753,the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological / philosophical foundations of the emerging confession . there is value in that . i look forward to reading part two , the liturgical ideas section . the emerging church is keen on praxis , but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom , which i had hoped we were past . here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book , which it might help to know : 1. rollins does not think it 's possible to really " know " much theology with " certainty . " in fact , to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an " idolatrous " view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is . this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans , and because in his view , god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way . the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views . he is very certain of his interpretations of " perceptive thinkers like nietzsche , freud , and marx , " eckhart , augustine , etc.. . and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct . i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really , really , faulty . as i 'm reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament . so , be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible 's basic content . he is certain that no one should be certain , but him . ok , to be fair , he is not certain if christianity is true , and says so on page 44 , but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity . nor , i guess , should you . with his view of " critique of ideology " how can he be so selective of what he is certain of . this seems like a self-defeating ideology . so strong is his disdain for " knowing " with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all . i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true , but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway . rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer , in my opinion . he says the church is not to be about giving answers , but helping raise in people : questioning . indeed , given his views , how could he provide answers ? this book may look deep . i propose , it is merely muddy . 2. he redefines age old terms . orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes , but how loosely one holds it . certainty of revealed truth is dangerous , misinformed , idolatrous . heresy is now a cute little thing . it has come of age . he says people will think his views undermine christianity . we are to just take him at his word that his views wo n't do so , but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would , i think , see the writing on the wall . 3. he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns . after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns , those like himself , at least , to even understand the gospel . he has not . how can he be a bridge ? to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores . christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down , not without mystery , nor without debate , but in a very real and tangible way . he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else . 4. he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them . the problem that is huge , and no one seems to notice , is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps . he considers fundamentalists , and by logical extension many evangelicals , to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term , heresy . i kept thinking , what kind of " fundamentalists " is he so angry at ? he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals , making generalizations that are misleading . very unobjective . unkind . very divisive . yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom . i can see his views bringing unity to all religions , but it will never bring unity to christendom . he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom . times have really changed in the past 20 years . he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind . 5. he makes god hopelessly difficult . god wanted , it seems , to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people , the dust of humanity , the lowly donkey ride , the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel . rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining " human reason " as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said " i am the truth " into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it . god 's message is simple . it 's clear where it needs to be . it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated . rollins makes it nearly all enigma , hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god , who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it , yet who has been unwilling or incapable , given man 's weaknesses , or his own lack of communication skills , to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly . if , as tickle says , this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium , then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man 's religion , the anything goes religion , and following generations will have to deconstruct today 's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism . peter , i can learn some stuff from you , and i 'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission . as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points . your views trouble me . nothing against you personally . forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone . i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more , though , it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor . regardless , if it inspires i 'll come back and add a star . hmmm
754,i like meav 's voice , and this cd is ok , if you like this kind of stuff . think slow and somewhat depressing . i think irish music has moved on so much since bill whehlan of riverdance brought it into the modern times , and came up with this vocal sound , i guess to hark back to earlier times , which worked well because riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music . this is all a bit samey and dull . i would say saved by this lady 's fine voice though
755,in the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them . i wish i had known this before . now i have to waste about $20 in shipping to return it . do not buy for body fat measurement
756,i had been hearing " always thinking of you . " but , i never got who it was . i purchased xm radio and on the smooth jazz channel , i heard the cut again and got the artist name . purchased the cd based on that one cut . every cut is great on this cd . i look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future . he has his own style . but , not only do you hear hints of benson and brown..........i hear a little doc powell as well . i will be introducing friends to this great artist............keep it coming........... .
757,this film can be interpreted any number of ways : as a farce ; a tragedy ; or just plain shakespearean comedy . brenda blethyn has , in the past , acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into saving grace with exquisite skill
758,i am in my early 30 's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line , chin and cheeks for the past couple of years . i have tried murad , proactiv , acnefree and many other systems without success . a month ago i picked up the neutrogena system when i saw it on sale . within five days days my skin started to clear . now , i have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system . i have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before . finally , a product that works and comes at a decent price !
759,after purchasing many dog training manuals and finding them not quite up to snuff , i was very pleased to finally find a book which was comprehensive and authoritative . it breaks each area of the sport down and is easy to follow . the book is intelligently written
760,the bloodshot gang knows how to have a good time ! if you 're into the whole alt.country thing , you know that some of it is very sincere and serious ( ie , uncle tupelo , jayhawks ) . now i love " no depression , " and " blue earth , " but this is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known as militant honky tonk , or just insurgent country . truth be told , this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant , serious numbers ( rico bell 's " money to burn , " the texas rubies ' " blue diamond mine , " mike ireland 's " i 'd like to " ) , but for the most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously . you 've got andre williams and sally timms singing " i 'll stick to you like glue.. . " , in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going " g-l-e-u , glue ! " you 've got a song with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss each other 's bodies . you 've got kim docter and moonshine willy belting out " turn the lights down low , " which really ought to be a hit it 's so catchy . and you 've got some great deadpan covers - - the waco brothers do a country rave-up of the who 's baba o'riley , " red star belgrade does it to ac / dc 's " highway to hell , " and best of all , the unholy trio turns public enemy 's " bring the noise " into an understated redneck anthem . i 'm only scratching the surface here , with 40 tracks over 2 discs . this is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on.. . and do n't miss the fantastic earlier bloodshot compilation , hell-bent ( insurgent country , volume ii ) - - see my 9 / 5 / 04 review
761,private investigator kinsey millhone is back again in this fourth installment of sue grafton 's alphabet series . this time she is offered a fee to give a $25 , 000 cashier 's check to a young man named tony gahan . the check for the fee bounces and kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her , plus the young man she is to give the cashier 's check to . everything she finds out about her client is bad . he is a drunk , who has killed several people in a car wreck , and appears to be a bigamist . when he is found dead , kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives . this book is written in grafton 's usual breezy style , and kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book . i would recommend the whole series to mystery-lovers
762,i 've found the omron very easy and practical to use . it gives very good estimates of body fat percentages and bmi ( body mass index ) which can easily be used to illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight training program . for the money , it would be difficult to find something better
763,i really love to get these for my wife , surprises are best when i give them to her , and she enjoys all of them from this great author , but she and i were not happy when i thought i found another of this super special portal series : - ( . having a new cover is nice but its a new publisher with nothing more than marketing in their minds , really hated to say this but we all know her books are super great , just know this is a reprint before you guy and like others , get a little ticked its not new after you fork over the cash and get your hopes up ! peace everyone : - ) jeff
764,looking at the liner photos makes clear that falkner is the prettiest thing this side of n sync ( and does n't he know it , especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of johnnie walker black by a leggy bunny flight attendant ) . which raises the question : is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an artist ? not to put too fine an edge on it , let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent . falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what ? his voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( & quot ; life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot ; ) or precious ( & quot ; suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound&quot ; ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that - - layers of sound , with a disspiriting sameness song after song . give him two stars simply because he can do all the stuff on the record , but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to , say , chrissie hynde and john hiatt cds . we 'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs
765,it is the declining days of the great war ( wwi ) , the germans are leaving a small french town but are leaving a little present for the advancing british troops . they have buried the munitions in the town square . when the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded . the town 's people evacuate . during this the barber sends off a message to the british . the british decide to send a man to check this out . they choose the bumbling scottish private plumpick ( alan bates ) . located on the outskirts of town is an asylum . the sisters who run the asylum escape with the town 's people , leaving the inmates to fend for themselves . they return to the town , resuming their lives before being commited . plumpick arrives in town but does n't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum . he meets the beautiful coquelicat ( genevieve bujold ) and falls in love with her . he finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb ( of course it 's more complex and hilarious than just that . ) he also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town 's people . the funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people . so shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves . this is half fairy tale and half fable . alan bates gives a great performance and genevieve bujold shows great whimsy . dvd extras : none
766,i have used quicken for over 12 years . whenever i got a new version , it always worked for me . but , it has too many things on it that i do n't need . i like to keep it more simple for me , so i just use the register , reconcile , reports , and lists-catagories . for all i use it for , i am happy with it
767,i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you should n't go higher than 1.4x . just keep in mind- -1.4x is only " 40% better " . it worked really well , but did n't increase the zoomage enough . i decided to go with a 2x ( that 's twice the zoomage ) teleconverter by kenko instead . i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas . you have to think about what you want- -i want to get in really close to the birds . i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm . it is an improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want to get twice as close , this is n't going to do it for you . if you want to get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . as far as quality , the quality is definitely there . five stars for quality , 3 for insufficient zoomage
768,these little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums . flossing with traditional floss hurt because i always cut myself and deeply . it probably saved me from serious gum disease , and that i understand is expensive to treat , so i 'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy
769,this case looks good and protects the camera adequately , but is too bulky . it has n't got a lot of room inside - i was unable to fit an extra sd card in its little case and a spare battery . the belt clip is difficult to use , and i end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time . there are better cases for this camera
770,this is the one i buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office . it is like the one i bought 5 years ago with my first baby , the one that is still humming along . i have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child , a boy who persists in having ' tiny ' ear canals even though he is three now . it has worked well for every other kid i know though . about the variation in temperature taking . my advice is to practice taking your and your children 's temperature while you and they are healthy . for one thing , not everyone has the ` standard ' 98.6 degree normal temperature ; and for another thing it is n't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal . it takes practice . a good home purchase . ( for really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success .
771,i am very satisfied with the 1999 cd by prince . it was in top condition when it arrived . i would purchase again from the seller . thank
772,beautiful , stunning absolutely gorgeous . a quick note to fellow brits , this was ordered on october 22nd and arrived on november 1st and is much cheaper here than on amazon.co.uk or anywhere else in the uk ! ! i 've ordered stuff domestically that has taken longer in the post ! !
773,every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight . we returned it to amazon , probably the first time we 've ever had to do that . for the price it should at least work . also , in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner . it earns two stars for looking great . i would not recommend it .
774,the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over . i brought them home and there is fog inside . also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens . i called bushnell 's help line and they told me.. . " well , it is n't internally fog proof , just externally " when asked about the stuff on the inside . " that is probably fungus , that sometimes happens " i just bought the binoculars ! ! ! he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out . avoid these at all costs ! ! ! they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck
775,i measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with la crosse charger , which i also bought from amazon . the capacity ranged from 547 mah to 2002 mah , with the average being 886 mah . that 's about a third of the stated capacity . before i took the measurements , i made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of aa nimh batteries : la crosse and energizer . both scored very close to their stated capacity . therefore , the test is valid and sunpak 's claim of 2650 mah is grossly overstated . my advice : avoid sunpak like the plague !
776,i use this film just normally for everyday stuff . it is n't grainy when you enlarge the photos , and the colors are just outstanding . i use the 800 for the really important stuff though because i think the colors are more vibrant . but , for just vacations , stuff around the house , the 400 will do a great job . anything less it basically a waste of money . i shoot at least a roll a week just of everyday life and this is the one that i choose all the time . i have a basket full
777,i have had omord hr-100c for a few months now . i use it wile on my treadmill . it seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate ; i think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin . i did have some trouble with the unit when i first started using it ; i replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem . the fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons i picked the omord brand . the hr-100c is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor
778,this is the best bargain for your money.pampers swaddlers are better than pampers . even better than costco brand . worth every penny
779,i have used wordperfect and quattro almost from their inception , so i have seen both of them improve over many years . those years of practise have resulted in wordperfect office x3 , a really outstanding product . because many other organizations and people that i work with use ms word and ms excel , in the past i have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response . now , however , wordperfect and quatropro can translate word and excel , incoming and outgoing . therefore , i no longer have to maintain two office programs . many years of using wp office have probably prejudiced me , but i find it more user friendly than ms office ; however , the biggest difference is that corel is responsive and helpful whereas ms is almost impossible to deal with
780,i have had several people take my pictures.at first , everything is fine.the pictures are ok.the next day , my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.it is soooo blury.then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury.i tried fixing it online ( like on the program for the camera ) and it would not work.i hate this camera ! ! ! not to mention the battery sucks.it lasts maybe 3 1 / 2 hours.this camera should be $99.00.trust me people......if i could rate this thing at a zero i would.it is not worth it.however , a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5.an awesome little camera
781,reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools . an imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer . i am not a master , but i do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are . when you use iso settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise . i think it is a great little camera and i have used it a lot on my latest photo project . keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size . this also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability . there is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it .
782,i just bought this waterproof case in order to use my canon s410 on a scuba diving trip . i was a little nervous at first ( i could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone ! ) , but i have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably ! i used it on 6 dives , and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet . i did not have one leak ! a word of caution- -i followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel ( just a small amount ) . i would like to think that the camera would not leak without this , but i did not want to take any chances . i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach
783,good camera for the $129 i paid . does everything pretty well , and your picture modes are pretty customizable . only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves / loads pictures to the memory card . might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures- - but probably would n't be doing it with this type of camera anyways .
784,i would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever wrong with the band jet , but when you do n't have any particular characteristics to call your own , there 's nothing to complain about . of course , this means that there 's nothing to compliment , either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands . people compliment them on bringing the ' old ' and adding the ' new.. . ' but i hear nothing new in their music . it 's just ordinary , clichï¿½d classic rock , except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago . if i want to listen to classic rock , i want to hear it on the classic rock stations , not the modern rock stations . those are for the new songs , only . an indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the pitchfork media website...i ca n't post the link due to strict review guidelines .
785,great features , right ? i just returned it after very disappointing results . here are just a few issues : 1. if you use a tripod ( and you will need to ) , you ca n't plug in the ac adapter to save on the short battery life , because mounting it on to a tripod covers the access to the ac connection . 2. battery life is very short . 3. if you want to protect the lens , you will need to buy the lens adapter and then buy a protective lens . 4. you ca n't take still photos with the flash if you are using the lens adapter because the adapter casts a shadow from the flash onto your pictures . 5. the automatic settings are horrible . the auto focus , auto white balance , auto anything will give you the worst results if shooting indoors . 6. you cannot adjust the manual focus or anything else once you begin recording . 7. quality is very poor when recording indoors without an enormous amount light . save your money . buy a camera with better features . i am waiting for the panasonic hdc-sd1 due in march
786,i cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par testament release . testament must have taken hints from metallica and tried to attract a different audience . this is not a horrible album , but compared to any other testament album , it is easily their worst . only the die-hard testament fan , or those into commercial metal should pick this up .
787,having read most of grisham 's books , i 've saved a few of his " best " for last . while it was n't a 5 star book like i 'd hoped , it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one . having saw the movie years ago , i had a good idea of what the book was about : two supreme court justices are killed , a law school student , along with many other people become curious and try to figure out " who dun it " ...only , she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head , and when the wrong people find out , she 's on the run for her life ! i enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced , and had a lot of detail . so much detail and characters , i had a bit of a struggle to keep up ! of course it was suspenseful and the characters , especially of darby , the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth . good read
788,we have used quickbooks on a pc since the 1990's . we loved the way inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting . quickbooks for mac is terrible in comparison . if you plan to use the payroll features , it is unusable . quickbooks mac payroll redirects you to the internet , where it is handled by paycycle ( an independent company ) . payroll is not integrated at all in the mac ( instead import / export operation ) . on the pc , it is part of the quickbooks application . we could not get job costing to work , and the tax calculations made no sense . we were paying tons of money to paycycle , so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically . we finally reverted back to quickbooks for windows and are much happier with intuit handling our payroll
789,my wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray . with all of the snow we have had , it arrived shortly after christmas , but just in time to warm her heart for the new year
790,the previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct . the description of this product is a misnomer . the heating pad never heats up , and takes forever to just warm up . on a scale of 1 to 5 , i would rate it a zero ! do n't waste your money on this . i will be returning mine
791,ca n't add much to the discussion about the movie , but wanted to say that this dvd listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of school daze . it says it has both full screen and widescreen , but it doesnt
792,i 've been using the sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and i am very pleased . at such a wide angle , you will most like need to " de-fish " your final shot which can be remedied with cs2 or some other image processing software . at 10-20mm , the range is almost too wide , but after further usage , i got used to it . i 'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to . the only drawbacks i know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare ( despite the marketing by sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare ) and the biggest aperture is f / 4 which is variable pending on the focal length . it is not a fixed aperture lens . i also find that this lens is at it 's sharpest around f / 8-f / 11 and i would n't go beyond that because i started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens . but other than that , i 've been pretty satisfied for the price i paid for this ultra wide angle lens . i still would prefer nikon 's 12-24mm , but i 'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens . sigma 's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable
793,the picture quality is okay , but the battery life is horrible
794,at first i was skeptical about buying an aging mccartney band tour dvd , even though i have every one , so i bought it . i watched it from start to finish . unbelievably superb . the lighting , the energy of the band and the crowd , suprising interviews ! ! and ole paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark ! after watching it i felt like i had been there . it is the best one i have seen yet ! if you like mccartney , this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear ! excellent buy
795,this is a great little dryer if you travel , or just for home use.well worth the price . cookiema
796,some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all , but the nikon 8400 has a " electronic viewfinder " and the reviews have been good and the price is great , so i bought the camera . the electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash , you cannot see any expressions , just the outline of the person 's head , so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder . outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot . the " display " lcd monitor is small and washes out in sunlight . the background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark . after 3 days of use and 90 shots i mailed it back to " ritz on amazon " this morning , dec 5. they require it back " within 10 days of receipt of purchase " , their " date of order " was nov 29 and it arrived at my house on dec 3. it 's a good thing i already had a compact flash card to use , there is not one in the box and if i had waited for the one i ordered to arrive , well , it 's not here yet . it cost me $11.65 to return it , insured , with 2 day delivery and a " delivery confirmation receipt " . the camera had some strengths as well as it 's weaknesses , but with only a short time to try it out before the " 10 days " ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what i was shooting i gave up on it
797,this program is causing many people difficulties . i had to make two seperate calls to customer service .
798,a dvd with a message that pulls at the heart , and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer . strong singing cast with excellent voices . a must see
799,eric reed is a monster pianist . under the right circumstances , he could record a christmas album that would become an instant classic . this , however , is an unfortunate example of what happens when an overconfident artist tries to do everything himself . reed produced and arranged this album himself . probably if he had hired an objective producer , that producer would have told him to hire an arranger . reed 's arrangements are second-rate . his version of " santa claus is coming to town " has been downshifted into a parody that serves as the worst example of an annoying trend : reed attempts to put a fresh twist on nearly every song . it 's an admirable goal , but he does n't have what it takes ; and the result is like a restaurant that serves hamburgers with a knife and fork , and swordfish crumbled over salad . it just does n't work . i hope this is n't the last christmas album from eric reed . he 's one of the truly original voices of his generation ; and with his gospel background and feel for the blues , there 's no doubt in my mind he could record an album that would rival " a charlie brown christmas . " but this is n't it . he needs to hand over the reins of his next project and focus on the piano
800,casein is a great , long-lasting protein , perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey . casein , in general , is bland ( think no fat , no salt , cottage cheese ) , and harder to mix than whey . optimum nutrition has here a decent casein , that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein i 've tried . the price is ok , but i 'd like to see it cheaper ( who would n't ? ) . i mix it with whey and use it throughout the day . i have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor
801,i purchased this camera after reading reviews and tech specs about the camera . it 's either not enough , or it 's too much ... i 'm not sure which . i returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel powershot a640 which has a swiveling view finder ( which is great ! ) and will suit my needs just fine for about $200 less .
802,this product does a superb job at converting audio cassette recordings to mp3 format on your computer or mp3 player . you can adjust the audio level and pause the recording and advance the audio cassette if you need to do those things . there are other automatic features to shut off , etc. it also can remove noise from the recording and clean up the transients
803,...but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one , and alpha video , the distributors of this classic capra movie , made no attempt to clean it up . here we have an example of a key artwork about america 's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s , crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves
804,i love danielle steel ! i ` ve read all of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned , ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins ( some explicit " parts " i didn ` t like at all ) .simply not the danielle steel we like . the story itselfs is ok ( gives the readers some " insights " behind the scenes of hollywood ) but... . some of her books i ` ve read over and over again . i am not going to touch secrets for a second time , however
805,i like the portability and adjustability of this mirror . it takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly . it serves my needs very well . i was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit . i tend to use the normal mirror more often . the other is the clock loses it 's setting when i stow it away . it has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature . as far as i am concerned...i was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock
806,yes , i love microsoft office . it 's incredibly user friendly , it has wonderful features , most of which i do n't even know how to use , and it 's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it 's kind . i 've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy microsoft for my personal use , the school would always buy one for me . and of course there are always illegitimate means.. . but i 'm not advocating piracy here . however , i would be the last person on earth to consider using microsoft office if i had to pay $350 for it . it 's an insane price . consider the alternatives : open office : does everything ms office does , some things even better . i love how you do n't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in open office . the best thing about this , however , is that it 's free ! google docs and spreadsheets : this one is even better . not only is it free like everything else from google , you can collaborate in real time with anybody else on the internet to write your word documents ! nothing beats that , it 's just the most wonderful thing that google has done
807,i got this showerhead for christmas and am really happy with it ! ! it 's really a pleasant experience to have the water raining down on you . i do agree with the other reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in place . but with mine anyways it stays in place while i 'm using it and it 's only later that it slowly lowers down . then i just move it back into place and tighten the knobs again when i want to use it . it has n't been any trouble so far . i love this showerhead so much that i 'm actually already looking for an even larger one ! ! i highly recommend these " rainfall " showerheads !
808,kudos to harvey fierstein for being so true to the jean poiret play . jerry herman did a wonderful score - my favorite song was " the best of times " . gene barry turns out to be a good singer , esp paired with the talented george hearn
809,this is an excellent battery that powers my canon 5d camera very well . although i have n't tested it against the spec for how many shots i can get from it , i 've been very impressed with the longevity of it 's charge
810,this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth . as some readers have complained , this is not really a " christian " book because the focus is n't on christ , it 's on you . a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally , the way jesus would , and not on trying to " find the perfect spouse . " the whole premise of the book is rather un-christlike : making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you . it 's rather selfish , really , when you consider the words of john the baptist : " christ must become more , i must become less , " as well as the warning in song of solomon " do not awaken love until it so desires . " should n't our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires ? finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines . hearts can be broken , and therefore authentic , christlike love must take precedence . i do n't mean to sound accusing , but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls " seduction . " my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a " poser . " this happens when ' forcing yourself ' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex . you have to ask : what kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity / femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are ? i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality . it is a combination of both action and faith that is important . faith to set the situations up . action to knock em down
811,i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican . funny . he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement . and let 's face it : he stink bombed george h.w. bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton . i 'm not saying bush would have won if walsh had n't indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election , but walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for bush . bush got him back , of course , by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve , 1992. the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least . as it wore on , however , it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans . let 's face it : people in power tend to be corrupt . they have protection the rest of us do n't have . this was n't just true about reagan and bush ; it 's true about clinton and whoever you wish to name . about halfway through the book , walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time , ghw bush . i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least . i guess when you ca n't beat a guy at the ballot box , you impeach him or at least try to . right ? not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside .
812,a boy has a college interview at a small academy and meets the other guys there . and they talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk . they go to classes and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk . then they go down to dinner and and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk . then nighttime comes and the boys all feel themselves up . in other words , this movie is vintage decoteau . it defies all known logic ( the boy shows up for his college interview , is accepted immediately and somehow moves in the same day with no luggage or discussion with parents ) , has lame effects and lots of half naked boys . it 's hard to tell if this is a commentary on the catholic church scandals or just another excuse to show writhing youg men in bed . definitely another laugh riot from the director of such " classics " as leeches and leather jacket love story
813,this is the easiest way i 've ever been able to make cd's . it realy makes photo cd 's easy and produces a great product . a group of frinds and us just got back from mexico and i put all of everyones photos in separate files on a cd . the automatic slide show goes through the differ n't files as if they were just one file with no seperation , but the pictures are still separated in each person 's file for ease when printing and so forth . it 's great , wish i would have had this years ago
814,the only reason that i am writing this review is because i am on line now looking for a new trimmer . i bought this " gem " less than a year ago and was not satisfied then . tonight , i 'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out . the extra cutting heads are all but worthless . i would never recommend this p.o.s to anybody . i wish i could give it 0 stars
815,undoubtedly the worst ' best of ' dvd ever made , even if someone gives this dvd as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this dvd i felt like burning down the company that made this dvd . if you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this dvd to him as a gift . there might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror , but it ca n't be for the actual dvd . there are n't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds . shame on the band for putting this out . obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a ' best of ' on dvd . this item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture . my taped videos on vhs from mtv and vh1 sound and look better than these ones , really . this essay in amatuerism may have some interest . for worse , is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90 's to 2000. ' love is blindness ' , ' walk on ' , ' elevation ' and several alternative videos were edited out . did n't they have another filmed version of ' gone ' ? . mexico city 1997 was just a below average performance . shame on u2 for keep going with ' gone ' from that bad shaped bono 's rough night . i still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song . im talking about ' until the end of the world' . in case you dont know , theres an actual video clip from that song . rather , they just put the well known sidney 1993 version here . rumors say they 're going to release a dvd boxset by late this year . i really do n't want ' remastered ' versions of shows we 've been watching for even 22 years . rather , i 'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage . just in case , here 's a list of several unreleased pro-shot filmed concerts from early 80 's to pop mart tour ( i did n't include elevation because there 're 2 dvd 's out there from the same tour ) . cheers 1 - belfast 23-01-1981 ( awesome concert ! ) 2 - berlin 04-11-1981 ( great goncert ) 3 - new york 22-11-1981 ( good concert ) 4 - hattem 14-05-1982 ( awesome concert ! ) 5 - roskilde 02-07-1982 ( awesome concert ! ) 6 - devore 03-05-1983 ( great concert ) 7 - st. goarshausen 20-08-1983 ( awesome concert ! ) 8 - dortmund 21-11-1984 ( awesome concert ! ) 9 - montreal 27-03-1985 ( great concert ) 10-los angeles 18-11-1987 ( awesome concert ! ) 11-dublin 31-12-1989 ( awesome concert ! ) 12-stockholm 11-06-1992 ( awesome concert ! ) 13-washington 16-08-1992 ( great concert ) 14-anaheim 14-11-1992 ( awesome concert ! ) 15-dublin 28-08-1993 ( awesome concert ! ) 16-adelaide 16-11-1993 ( great concert ) 17-rotterdam 18-07-1997 ( awesome concert ! ) 18-sao baulo 31-01-1998 ( great concert ) 19-santiago 11-02-1998 ( awesome concert ! ) what the hell are u2 waiting for ?
816,i bought this recording with high hopes . what better complement to reading shakespeare than hearing him , right ? well , not with this recording . the cast is made up of & quot ; distinguished actors , & quot ; the insert proclaims , but it 's obvious that these actors have n't done shakespeare since they were in junior high school . nor have they improved since then : none of the actors has any feel for the shakespearean line . the speaking is stiff and mechanical , and half the time it sounds like a monty python farce ! when there are no visual effects to distract us , low-quality acting really sticks out . for audio recordings , you need the best voices . too bad arkangel did n't realize this . my advice ? grind up these cds and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums
817,i 'm not a professional but this lens makes me feel like one . it is a very versatile lens , working well inside or out , low light or extremely bright . am looking forward to taking sporting pictures next spring
818,this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film , and has many flaws : a silly plot , cheap religious imagery ( dracula is judas , jeez louise ) , and not one truly sexy or scary moment . and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula 's brides , including jennifer esposito & jeri ryan . if you ca n't make a film sexy with these two , you 're in the wrong business . craven has an over inflated rep as a director , he does n't deserve any rep as a producer , if this leaden film is a sample . it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison . save your money and pick up something scary instead , like bava 's black sunday or any hammer horror
819,i 've always been a fan of roger moore 's james bond , but what i 've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his bond movies were , like , actually good . " the spy who loved me " is not one of them . oh , sure , it 's fun - - almost all of the bond flicks are fun - - but it 's basically just a kid 's movie , and that 's not necessarily a good thing . ( 1 ) stromberg is a lame villain . yes , his underwater lair is well-designed , but it 's silly . not as silly as that ice palace in " die another day , " but pretty silly . ( 2 ) barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls . she 's not an ugly woman , to be sure , but she was a terrible actress ; she sounds like she 's reading - - poorly - - from a cue card in ever single scene she 's in . ( 3 ) jaws is a stupid character . having metal teeth would n't actually make you capable of biting through metal . the metal you were biting would resist , and you 'd end up just tearing up your gums . i do n't expect realism from 007 movies , but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic . ( that said , jaws is effectively used , and richard kiel was excellent in the role . ) ( 4 ) the disco score is terrible . terrible . ( 5 ) the plot is nothing more than a rehash of " you only live twice , " but on the ocean rather than in space . certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies ! embarrassing . i love bond , but this is not one of the highlights . the dvd is good , with a couple of fine documentaries , but the commentary track grates , because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did . even if that were true , it 'd be annoying
820,a little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better . ms. cantrell spends the majority of the book being a relationship / marriage counselor , and though it 's true issues become larger in smaller spaces , there are more issues for women cruisers than just their relationship dynamics . as i said , practical logistical information would have suited me better .
821,the other day i used a friend 's standard digital camera for a little while . the whole time i found myself missing the manual zoom , instant response and convient manual buttons on my d50. this camera takes amazing pictures . as an dslr beginner i used the camera in auto mode for the first several weeks , now after reading some books on photography i 'm slowing starting to use the manual features . the d50 lets me choose the level of control that i 'm comfortable with , from full manual to full automatic ; and both options are just a turn of the dial away . the body of this camera is built like a tank . metal and high quality plastics abound . the buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable . it is a beautiful piece of precision engineering
822,this book is a very detailed starting point for renaisance fans . at its heart this is a socio-economic history . the clever inclusion of climate and geographic conditions presuasively explained why prosperous capitalism grew in some regions while others remained stagnant . chapter 5 - " the human unit " was the most informative . most facets of history are here for the reader to absorb . this is the type of book we all wished we had in school
823,i saw this crapfest in the theater and i should have known what i was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window , but at the entrance of the theater as well . i only gave it one star because there was n't a " no star " rating- -even though it deserves a negative rating . as a horror fan , i was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started , it seemed to have alot of promise . but once we met baby and her " family " the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate . the movie was disgusting , repulsive , and made no clear sense- -at least with michael or freddie you knew what the h*ll was going on . and i thought that blood sucking freaks and blood sucking vampires from pittsburgh sucked , but corpses not only sucked , it blew . as a friend told me later , " what in the h*ll did you expect from rob zombie ? " what did i expect indeed . no wonder most production firms refused to touch this film
824,this is the all time , great , original classic . the remake is .......ok at best . add this to your classic movie collection . highly recommended
825,1 year old.. . 3 e18 errors 2 battery erros shipped back for service 4 times ! search the net for e18 before you buy !
826,great product . takes some thought , but once you learn it , its great
827,this creatine works very good on me building muscle , it has no flavor , i recommend it with a good diet ! ! see results in weeks !
828,feeling more than a bit fleeced by mcafee 's overpriced " subscription " renewal every year , i decided to give kaspersky a try . installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot- --just stalled on a blank screen right after the windows xp splash screen . when trying to boot up in safe mode , a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen . it stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever . a little research at work showed that this was a kaspersky file . it may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts to use a recovery disk failed . a trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives ( which were in the inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not be recovered ( unless i wanted to ship them to a recovery shop , and nothing on them was worth that much ) . so they 're going to reinstall windows , i 'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when i finally get my computer back , and , yes , i 'll lose all the data that was on there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all the kids ' photos- --well , most of them . thanks , kaspersky ! ) anyway , perhaps my attempts at recovering the os caused the worst of this . whatever the case , i believe the boot failure was caused by either the kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus . who knows . kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios . i do know one thing : i am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again . and kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail . i got an automated " we received your e-mail " response , but nothing more , even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two . that was over a week ago . if in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me , then i still do not apologize for the one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i 'm insane or that this was just a fluke , at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product . that might mean the difference between losing data / spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced . and do n't expect much assistance from kaspersky should things go wrong .
829,this has already been expressed here in the reviews , but just as a reminder one more time.... . this dvd is not the original version . the original version has more material and is much better . hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time .
830,this movie is a reallllllllllllly scary movie . the only part i did n't like was that pervert mikks in the beginning . be warned of grossness . that is all i need to say
831,seems panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo dslr market , with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with ois . excellent pictures out of the box , menu operations are plentiful , nr can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for aperture or shutter is very professional . leica lens is crisp and sharp , i shoot in aperture priority with nr at minimal and the pictures even in jpeg look like they have been post processed , simply amazing . after experiencing this camera i sold my nikon d80 , attachment lens and soft pictures nikon was giving me is unacceptable , i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped rgb3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the panasonic . high speed usb is my only complaint for data transfers , noise reduction for higher iso noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking , a 3 " , screen would be nice but maybe on the next model . btw , moon shots with the raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical , hand held shots with ois ( image stabilization ) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures , you actually have a telescope with ois at your reach , simply amazing . 100% satisfied .
832,i bought this software primarily so i could create slideshows with music and other special effects . since i got it , i have had nothing but problems . first of all , it would not install completely on my computer . the techs at adobe could not figure out the problem . after i reformatted my hard drive , i finally got photoshop to install properly . then another problem . when i burned my slideshow photos to a vcd , they came out just awful ( unlike adobe 's demo video showing a perfectly created slideshow . ) boy , was i deceived ! i cannot say that this software is all bad . it does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos . however , if you want to create neat slideshows , photoshop elements 4.0 is not worth the cost
833,this is a great , funny book . it may be my favorite jeeves & wooster story
834,this documentary on the life of louis armstrong , one of the major proponents of the jazz genre of music , is a quick look at how louis armstrong developed into a jazz musician as a vocalist , trumpeter , band leader , and arranger . ' louis armstrong - satchmo ' starts with louis 's life growing up in new orleans and how he spent much of his time in an orphan home playing in a band , which is where his skill had room to take off . the documentary follows his move to chicago and his involvement in the early jazz recordings . the dvd contains excerpts of live performances and also tracks louis armstrong 's gradual but swelling rise to fame and how he attained the nickname " satchmo " . louis , with his love for performing , became a famous musical figure and eventually had the rare achievement of being featured as a performer in many movies . the docu-biography reveals how louis never lost his lovable , down-to-earth manner , even with the increased size of his audience . louis was just louis , and he would always be loved for his smile , his lovable personality , and of course his music . containing interviews with tony bennett and wynton marsalis , ' louis armstrong - satchmo ' is a pleaser about a jazz player 's rise to become an enormously famous popular entertainer . and he never lost his charm . we love you , louie
835,ewww ewww get it off get it off ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! omigod i loved hugo so much i 've been anticipating this in the mail and bought the shower gel from a different source as well . this is just terrible . i 'm taking a shower . look for my posting of this cheap...i 've already taken a loss . i have reviewed many colognes , take a look at them . i like most of them
836,i bought this one as a cheap extra battery . i have seen no differences in performance so far and would therefore recommend this as a great extra or replacement battery
837,there are 2 really good songs on here . the first is " untitled , " which sounds like gibbard was listening to a lot of brian wilson at the time he wrote it . the percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds . " underwater " is a pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is " send packing . " it really is a beautiful , well-written song . the rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments . basically , the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly . all in all , i would n't spend 10 bucks on it , but a couple tracks are pretty good
838,i 'm using it for a few months now ; i have n't found a single problem so far . earlier , i was using an old finepix and the optic / sensor sensitivity was not very good ; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment . this is not a problem any more . also , i was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom . in general , i was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera ; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out : - ) . sure , there are better cameras on the market ; however , considering the price it is just a great deal
839,for less than $200 this is a great camera . it is by no means spectacular , but for the price , it does a good job . i own a canon powershot s60 as well , and the canon outdoes this camera in some ways , but it 's not pocketable . the f20 is easy to use , the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive , it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly , and shutter lag seems average ( close to the s60 ) . however , the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a dslr . the " anti-shake " mechanism is not really useful at all , it merely boosts the iso to 2000 which makes the image unprintable ( at least indoors ) . i have yet to try it this feature outside . i 've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights , especially outdoors . manually setting the iso from 100-400 will , i hope , make for more printable , usable pictures . i had actually thought of returning this little camera , but then realized that i could find nothing , for the price , that would be able to compete . i really wanted a 28mm lens , only found on more expensive models like the canon sd800is , or lumix 's ( which apparently have tons of noise at low iso 's ) . it 's pocketable , portable , and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it .
840,i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women . men are to rule , and women are to submit to that rule . the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men , rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level . i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read " discovering biblical equality . " it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women
841,there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i do n't need to add anything in that regard . but , what on earth does a lesbian sub-story ( in both regards ) have to do with the story as a whole ? nothing . so , we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the appalachian way of life that , instead , heads for the trash bin
842,warning ! this video has no captioning . i 've rented it and it does not have captioning . it is useless to me and fellow deaf and hard of hearing folk
843,i have been hankering after this great album on cd for a long time now . imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available . surprise turned to shock when i saw the price . does the company that produces this cd not realise that are people all around the world ( including south africa where i live ) who are very keen on this album ? at this stage though , it is only the very wealthy that can afford it .
844,i bought this to go with my ms2-200bpt shaver . i saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well . i 've been using it for about 1 month and i could n't agree more . a quick spray on the cutters after shaving , and the next time i use it , it runs like new . i can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since i 've started using it . as a bonus , it seems to last quite a while . another strong product from remington
845,i tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that i put it down in frustration . it reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat . the theme is interesting , the execution poor . cannot recommend
846,this film seems a lot better than kodak max 400 even though it is basically the same thing ( except for the fact that it 's black and white ) . i would n't recommend this for proffesionals , but it 's great for the average person
847,ed friedlin is a monthly writer for bass player magazine . he covers in an excellent way how to slap , pop , mute , develop a groove , how to play with drum machines , ghost notes , and does some licks in larry graham , louis johnson , and marcus miller style and it is laid out in a very good manner . very good instructional video
848,i was very suprised at how small the units were ( i ordered 2 ) . but they work great and run very quietly . the filter is very easy to change . i have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that i switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space . i would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money
849,i wanted to give this cd as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie . i listened to it first to make sure the quality was good . i was so surprised when all i heard was music and no words . although the music is nice , i know she would not be too impressed . we had seen the movie together and we loved mr. ray 's song and wanted to know the words . it 's too bad that i 'll have to return or sell it
850,the pressure on the rain setting is so low you have to keep it on the concentrated spray to really wash the soap out . switching between the two causes a cold stream to come out for a second or two till it clears . also it is not sturdy - when the showerhead is moved to a higher position it does not stay and falls back down to the lower position . i will be returning mine
851,i was intrigued by the title , which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity . well , after 60 pages or so , i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that . the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life . but , i say that any religious life ( be it christian , islam or otherwise ) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional . i am convinced that yoda is a zen master ; the force is derived from tao , not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion ( i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism , which is another beast altogether . ) . a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is " the dharma of star wars . "
852,i got the pleasure of seeing albert open for bb king . unfortunately for bb king , because once albert started playing his flying v , with blues power , he demoralized anybody that came after him . he had the entire universal amphitheater standing . and stayed standing for most of his show . blues power is one of his best . get , listen , and then really listen . because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes. .
853,china : the panda adventure is an imax film that tells a story. . so..in a sense the pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary . the story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving ruth harkness who has arrived in china to take care of the business affairs of her late husband . her husband , it seems was a great admirer of the giant panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them..this leads ruth to seek these pandas out to see for herself..as the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of china..the cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well. . ruth is played by the lovely maria bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the panda. . all in all..this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family..but be warned..it 's more of a story involving the panda and not a documentary .
854,this breviary is disappointing to traditional catholics ! novus ordo catholics will be right at home with this but if you are a traditional orthodox catholic who favors the roman rite and who has been traumatized by the profanations inflicted by iconaclastic innovations , this is the same ole same ole vatican ii " stuff . "
855,nothing deep , by any means , but simply a light , airy listen , with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes . even though the songs ( most of them ) were n't in the movie , they remind me of it , of the whole hawaiian atmosphere . my favorite tracks , excluding the ones included on the previous cd , are blue hawai'i ( by elvis ) , my little grass shack , coconut ( it 's just bizarre , but addicting , making you smile with absurdity ) , island in the sun , pineapple princess , and love me tender . again , it 's nothing dramatic or swirling , but it you adored lilo & amp ; stitch ( and how can you not ? ) and all it stood for , this cd might just bring some warmth into a cold day . do n't think about it . listen and pretend you 're there
856,you can shave anything without putting future fatherhood at risk , though it takes some patience to get things really smooth . i 've used it repeatedly over the past three months without any major problems . my skin was a little sensitive after the first time , but no terrible pain or anything , and there 's none at all now that i 'm accustomed to using it . it is possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving , but if you read the instructions first you should be fine . a couple of very minor drawbacks : it 's rather noisy , more so than a regular electric razor , and if you use the comb attachments , it 's tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the same time . but that pops right back in , so not a big dea
857,i bought this cd after hearing tony on one of the am morning shows , and really likings some of his past offerings , but i have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money . i was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money 's worth . tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years , and i expected a more mature offering from him than this latest . there is a great lack of maturity on this cd , and it 's an overall disappointment . unfortunately , i have to say here that toney is not alone . what on earth possessed veteran soul singers the o'jays to sing a song like let 's ride ? who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages ? hoochie mommas ? what ? babyface ? even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd ! and what 's up with the explicit lyrics ? we all know you can curse like sailors , but why is this language necessary in music ? and i know that artist have always performed their music , but will someone tell me why it 's necessary to perform with so few clothes on ? i would rather hear your music , not see your booty ! sorry , but a review i just read triggered me , and i 'd been thinking about the tony terry cd for a while . hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time . meanwhile i think you 're safe in skipping this particular cd
858,i pruchased the 3 computer product . i installed and have been in email tag with norton support ever since . my computer will not shutdown after installation . they have no idea why . i have been through the same protocols over and over again for over three weeks . i was finally told that installing version 7.02 would fix it for sure . i did and it did not . i was also told that unlike other products such as webroot , when you buy a three ciomputer pack , then expiration date is tied to installation on the first computer . if the three computers do not have the same installation date-like mine -i had 2006 installed on three computers which were put on at different times-you can lose the value of the subscription . when i called norton customer service -i get the reply that what can you expect we gave you a bargain-about 70 on a three computer deal . the service was rude and not helpful . i asked why it did not say anthing on the box or in the manual and was told that was my proble ,
859,this is one of those rare cds that you 'll leave in your car cd player for months and not get tired of , because it fits most moods . feels like melissa etheridge meets cheryl crow , with an old blues feel here and there , and some nice , heavy tori amos-like piano and vocals here and there too
860,at first , i thought this product was great , and i used it for a few days . then , i noticed that my face was getting red and swollen . now , i look all deformed . i am really upset ! ! the acid ate away at my face and i am still waiting for my face to heal . i called neutrogena and they said it is probably an allergic reaction . march 23 , 2007 , update : after the swelling on my face went down , my whole body started itching , and i had to go see two different doctors . the internist said that it got into my system , and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of my system . i took the medication for over 2 weeks , and used cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching . my arms and legs are all scared . there are still marks now even though my arms and legs have healed . this was the worst product that i have ever used , and i do n't even have sensitive skin . i never had a problem with a product ever ! ! i was very careful when i used rapid clear . it never got in my eyes , nose , or mouth . i used it once a day for a week until my face swelled up and turned all red . i looked like the character on mask . horrifying ! ! ! i will never ever buy another dangerous product from neutrogena , again ! ! ! ! i will tell everyone what happened to me ! ! ! the funny thing is.... . one person that i told this to , who also saw my swollen face , .... she said this exact thing happened to her with another neutrogena product . so , i know it 's not just me ! what the heck is neutrogena putting in their products ?
861,i purchased turbo tax after reading the reviews here...someone had mentioned a glitch , but someone else mentioned a work around . bottom line , if you can sit down with all your records and do the whole turbo tax from start to finish in one swoop , you 're fine . but if you need to start and stop while completing the schedule 2 business aspects of your tax return , get ready for a huge problem...it does n't let you back in ! i went to their website where they had both a work around , and a report that if you update your turbo tax ( very easy ) the glitch will be fixed . not so , it did nothing for me . then i tried the workarounds...i got back in once but the next time i tried to use the work around a few days later , it did not work . i ended up having to call an accountant 1 week before the 17th and thank goodness i was able to get an appointment . also , if you have a business and do n't understand some of the tax workings , like depreciation , it is very difficult to translate your former accountant 's previous year 's work into the new turbotax . it 's not set up that way , so you need to know what you 're doing . i have a college degree and a lot of stick-to-it-ness , but i could not figure out and be sure that i was entering things correctly . and then , it did n't matter anyway , as i could n't get in to change anything in the end . finally , make sure you save , save , save as you go ! while doing my turbo tax and having spent a couple of hours already , i logged into their website to get some support . when i " x " ed out of the internet page , it closed my turbotax screen that i 'd opened on my computer . guess what ? it was all lost and i had to start from the beginning . that was before i was even impacted by the " glitch " later . this program does not remind you to save when you close , or ask you if you want to save , so be sure and save all the time ! so , good luck to anyone who tries this . for me , it was a huge disappointment and i am returning it to amazon for a refund due to the glitch . i honestly do n't know how they can sell something with such an obvious problem .
862,when i played the first composition on this cd , i started thinking that perhaps i had purchased a really stellar cd because the first song was really jumping . but after that , this cd is disapointing to me . there are maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally unmemorable . with the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her first cd , joyce cooling could have made one good cd . but , in my opinion , there are n't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this cd . joyce certainly has potential , but she needs to work on her creativity . she sound here like an artist still maturing in style
863,i 'm having a hard time understanding who would pay money for this downgrade ? you 'll wish you had the " xp upgrade " as soon as you do it . it 's just baffling that they would charge this much for such an awful product
864,i just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one i had for years . i read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices , price being the primary concern . the saying you get what you paid for is true ! ! the heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap . pay more and be happier
865,so i saw that this product got 5 stars , so i ordered it......when i got it , its like " um.. . is that it ? ? ? " it 's really cute , and really well made , but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards.. . also , there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it , also , the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all.. . other than that , it 's cute , but not the best out there .
866,i only had it for a few hours and after that i knew i would be returning it . its video quality is quite horrible , just better than a videophone and average of a webcam . i should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive . but honestly , i prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is . it 's quality will not be any better unless your outside , and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun , this would not do . you basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow . this also is a pain for mac users . it says it 's able to import files , and yes it can , but in asf format . now you can play it in vlc , but think you 'll be able to convert it , think again . it converts just fine , except without audio . i 've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio . so , mac users , pick something else . it is being returned , for certain
867,very light electric razor . cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes . so a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week . when running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade . does a great job very quickly and smoothly . you do n't need anything more
868,if you are looking to take high quality pictures , then look elsewhere . it is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you , but not much else . ( or for a beginner in photography or a child . ) you have to hold very still if you do n't want your pictures to come out blurry . also , the flash makes images far too bright and if you do n't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark . the only thing i like about this camera is it 's size . it 's great to just keep in your pocket or your bag.. . anyway , i 'm buying a better one soon
869,compared to the olive & aloe bar , this one seems to lather better
870,just received it and used it and can only say it is the greatest shaver ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the closest shave , no razor burn , fastest shave yet and very quite . thank you norelco for this great saver . j
871,i would have liked a more real story in this dvd
872,i have been using this stuff regularly for about 10 months post workout & for meal replacement to keep up protein intake . i read alot about mixing whey with coconut water & that is how i have been taking it ( blended with a couple ice cubes ) . if you like strawberry shakes this will be really easy for you to take , i do & i actually look forward to the shake
873,works better than i could have hoped . i have used it for about a month and it is very simple to execute - - but you have to be able to hold somewhat steady which is not a problem for me . if you are someone who has the shakes - - may be a problem . i have compared the accuracy to gps devices with guys playing with me . this is better since it gives you the actual yardage to the pin . also , you can get yardage to another golfer in the field , and yardage to any object , bunker , tree etc. , which the gps can't . a lot of courses are not marked correctly , and , of course , yardage changes depending on how far off to the side of the fairway - - or even out of the fairway - - you are . this is where it is especially nice . there are times when without this device you are just flat out guessing . this is an awesome piece of technology . it was well worth the price for me .
874,i 've been using apple 's macintosh systems since 1984 and have seen some great improvements in system stability , which i consider the most important aspect of an os . first off tiger is a smooth running system ( when it is smoothly running ) , and has some of the nicest bells and whistles around . the best dog-and-pony show around . that being said , watch out ! this os is capable of completely hosing your user settings , all your software registrations , bookmarks , email settings , etc. the whole enchilada . any os that can do that at the drop of a dime is n't worth the time . since i use disk warrior , cocktail and disk utility regularly , this should never have happened . i waited until the os was at the 10.4.3 stage before upgrading from 10.3.9 - - apparently it is not yet ready - - best to wait another year before upgrading . hopefully these bugs will be fixed
875,i admit that i 'm far from an expert on digital cameras . i did take over 32 , 000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years . i purchased a 510 powershot in july of 2005. it was n't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work . i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them . i can understand them saying , ' we 'll charge you at first , but once we establish that the fault is due to us , we 'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera ( in the mail ) and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back . ( i also emailed them the same request ) . neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon 's behalf . that in itself was enough for me and i 've been bitter about that ever since . i 've also told every person that i 've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident . i 'm pleased to say , i 've steered most away from this company . what else can i say about this camera : this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture . i 've missed out on some good shots due to this . it eats batteries like there 's no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa 's to even make this camera worth its while . i 've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a 3 minute movie ( with this camera ) in my home during the day and go outside , most things outside are very white . almost like looking at an infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during the day , everything is dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras are this way ? i would n't recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think about that . you have to pay the shipping for a camera that 's barely a few months old and still under warranty . that 's disgusting , that 's all i have to say . there should be a zero for this , not a 1 star
876,i am not jewish , but you do n't have to be to enjoy these songs . this album happens to be one of my favourites of the putumayo releases . a couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though i thought i knew none of the songs when i bought this album . each and every song on here is wonderful...some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions . the 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of jewish music , and each artist has a page about them , including a photograph . i highly recommend this album to just about everyone . my husband is arabic and he too loves these songs . music truly is borderless
877,sidney bechet was one of the first real fathers of jazz . burns puts together a great combination of early recordings . jazz historions note bechet as one of the only horn players that could keep up with louis armstrong . you have to include bechet in your jazz collection , and this one is as good as any
878,edible taste , not the best but i would keep buying them if i did n't get the worst stomach ache that leads to to a dirrahea . it is not just this met-rx bar that will do this to you , it is any food with sugar alcohols . all atkins food is based on sugar alchols such as maltitol and sorbitol . they do not effect your blood sugar like regular sugars do , so the theory is that they dont store fat . only edible if you are within 20 feet of a clean bathroom . you only have 15 minutes to get to the bathroom . not worth it
879,this cd has tons of power , and soothing energy . it really shows off how well part understands the human voice
880,the program works fine on windows xp and is easy to use . it lets you print cards of many sizes . the big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program . the back of the box claims & quot ; 4500+ cards and sentiments , celebrate life 's special moments with cards for all occasions&quot ; . that 's nice . the problem with that is that i counted the total number of cards that come with the program . it only adds up to 1045 ! so where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments ? are you supposed to design them yourself ? i just do n't know . and certainly & quot ; cards for all occasions&quot ; means just that , does n't it ? well there 's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind . i guess you just need to buy those on your own
881,i can only say that this was my favorite record of last year . this record is hard to find in your local record store , so search it out.. . incredible - ca n't wait to hear more !
882,what can i say ? more spidey than you can shake a stick at for peanuts . if you ever wished you had the patience to cut out and neatly collect all the sunday paper comics in a nice neat scrap book then this is the book for you . i 'm planning on buying the lot and thoroughly enjoying my strolls down memory lane
883,this book is a must for anyone who works with older adults . it is a photographic essay of some very special people....people who embrace the robustness of life , and who are disciplined to maintain their capabilities as long as possible . our world is steeped in ageism , that is , believing that older people are only capable of doing things that are & quot ; appropriate&quot ; for their age . this book shatters those beliefs and provides living examples of people who continue doing what they love to do physically . i wish that etta clark would revise this book with a new set of photos every year ! i have seen some of these photos over and over again in lectures that people give about aging . it is a book to be owned , not borrowed
884,plot summary : a man-without-a-memory found floating in the mediterranean sea searches for his identity , discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin . reason for the rating : violence and some language . based on the robert ludlum-authored book by the same name , the bourne identity is part action flick , part stylized thriller . in his first role as an erstwhile action hero , matt damon shines as bourne , imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't -know-who-he-is ease . as the story opens , bourne is pulled out of the mediterranean sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an italian fishing boat . the " hey , this is a story about espionage " theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from bourne that displays what we later learn is a swiss bank account number . upon finding and opening the safe deposit box , bourne discovers multiple passports ( including one with the name jason bourne ) , a variety of foreign currency , and a gun . he then begins his search to uncover his true identity- -and until now , so does the audience . if there is one misstep in the bourne identity , it may be the fact that early scenes involving the cia and the agency 's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to bourne 's identity far earlier than bourne himself . at this point the film becomes more of a " how will he survive ? " thriller rather than a " who am i ? " mystery . a love interest of sorts ( played nicely by run lola run actress franka potente ) gives bourne a " partner in crime " to play off of for much of the movie , but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development . an implied ( off-screen ) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief , but does n't detract too much from the action . the most interesting ( and morally significant ) moment in the film comes when bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on . through this pivotal flashback ( and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense ) , we learn that the highly-trained killing machine is n't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target 's children in the room with him . bourne 's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film 's premise as he is shot , falling into the mediterranean sea . smartly directed , the bourne identity is fast-paced without feeling rushed . the cinematographer paints the european setting in shades of grays and yellows , giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama . as an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities , this film is a winner for older teens and adults . nappaland.com recommends : ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride- -the bourne identity is a worthy discovery . after the show...if members of your family choose to view this movie , use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward : - --what do you think prompted jason bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht ? what does this say about bourne 's moral compass ? - --how would you feel if you suddenly could n't remember who you were ? what actions would you take to discover your identity ? - --when faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done , jason bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew . when have you felt that way ? how can a relationship with jesus give us a " second chance " in the truest sense ? s
885,i am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price . i add it and use it for landscapes , mountain views , nature images and such , and also for group pictures in family photos . it does what is supposed to do : it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear , and in this way the pictures appear more natural - - a whole view and not a narrow frame - - with perspective and deepness also , quite similar it seems to me to what i see with my own eyes . a very useful additional tool
886,this is a great collection of the many " atom bomb " songs that are in movies such as " atomic cafe " , dr. strangelove , and other films of the genre . i highly recommend this to anyone who collects " bomb " memorabilia
887,great product for what it does ! however , my experience with quicken products such as will maker is that there are no updates . you 'll have to buy the next year 's version to stay up to date for changes in your state . at the end of 2007 , the software is obsolete
888,this dvd contains all of the original ben stiller show episodes , plus an extra un-aired episode . the show was not only far ahead of its time , but also timeless as is evidenced by stiller 's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the tv series . for anyone who was a fan of the tv series or stiller 's movies , this dvd is a must
889,i got this product when the price dropped down to $12. so for that price i liked this product a lot . it heats the lotion well . initially i thought it was small , but now i think it is the correct size . i did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this . i switch it on when i go for a bath and by the time i am back , the lotion is ready and warm . it is a great buy , and for all you bargain shoppers , wait till the price drops . it is especially a great buy during winter
890,purchased a printer dock and camera bundle , from a local office supply store for $100. it only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge , so i purchsed this from amazon . amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping . it works great . no complaints . the paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that i still use for some pictures , but works well for my classroom , to give to my students . the pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them
891,dr. riter 's real-ease is a simple , gentle , and healing neck support . it is effective , easy to use , and affordable . it helped healing post accident , and with general body pain healing and relaxation
892,this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy . it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives , not unlike our own . but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity . it avoids going too far into the subjective . it does n't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute / stagey displays of animal interaction . instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments . but by the sheer genious of editing and writing , one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama . the movie wisely lets the animals ' behavior " do the talking " , and does n't try to push the viewers ' judgement one way or the other . it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals , emotions , and the nature of our ( and by ' our ' i mean all of god 's creatures ) existence
893,we are in the last part of the 19th century in this novel , and the wild west has breathed its last . the book is peopled with real legends ( calamity jane , buffalo bill , sitting bull ) and fictional curiosities ( jim ragg and bartle bone - two mountain men , and no ears - an indian with exceptional eyesight ) . mcmurtry relates a sad , elegiac farewell to times past . the ever-interesting characters and their views of the world , which are wise and funny and fascinating , make the novel top-notch in the mcmurtry canon
894,this is not a good film . i wanted to like it because i love south park and i think that trey parker and matt stone are comedic geniuses . while it shows brief glimpses of some of their future brilliance , overall it 's just not very funny . i think i laughed twice during the whole film . watch it to see the south park guys " before they were stars " , but do n't expect much
895,what can you say about mfl that has n't already been said . sublime , perfect , classic . this is still the definitive recording of the show , and no one has ever come close to the original cast . sadly , while the movie is wonderful , had warner bros . used andrew 's it might have been one of the greatest film musicals of all time . and while audrey hepburn gamely gives it her all , andrew 's had clearly made eliza doolittle her own , and she would have been uncomparable on film , and raised the level of the entire movie . well , the rest is history , andrews went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60's . still , probably the best example of a play being adapted into a musical . as george bernard shaw said ( when he finally gave in and saw it during it 's london run ) " i do n't know where shaw ends and lerner and lowe begins .
896,this camera / mp3 / camcorder / webcam / voice recorder is way to good to be true ! i brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies . but i was sadly mistaken.. . this camera just takes cheap pictures and videos . the only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that i had no need for . after about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better i gave up and sold it on ebay for the same price as i brought it for . it 's a great idea.. . but it just is n't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice . the mp3 player is n't all that wonderful either . it does n't work with itunes . or easy work with windows . hope this helps.. . i wish i would have read this before i brought this camera
897,if you have n't seen this you should . great movie . never get tired of seeing it . i think any age could watch this
898,i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years . i was born & raised in the north . i think evans should rename his book " fiddler on the roof in the south " . his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here . it 's very much : the southern jews were all so happy , they all fit in and were accepted , etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us ' yankee jews ' , like the instances when a few ( yankee ) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights . evans should realize that times have really changed here ! the evangelical christians in my town ( which is most people here ) harrass me like crazy - ' i am praying for you ! ' ' have you read the words of jesus , who was a jew like you ? ' ' when will you come to my church' . blah , blah , blah . thank god for the minority of catholics , methodists , presbyterians and a few others who live here . they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am , and the way i will stay - a jew . i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience . jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences , and that they cannot relate to what i am saying . but i do want to ask evans a few questions : 1 ) if things are so great for the jews in the south : why have you lived in new york for decades now ? ? ? 2 ) why do n't you at least write either a new forward to the book , a magazine article , etc. , contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time ( for some of us at least ) , primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians ? i read evans ' books before i moved here , and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here . for a jew who really cares about her / his religion living here is depressing ; it is practically jew-less ; and , at best , the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me . ( by the way , i am planning to move to a city ! ) by the way , do n't bother writing to me to tell me that i am " wrong " , or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church . believe me , with all the praying for me that is going on in this town , and all the myriad attempts to convert me , if it has n't happened by now , as they say in these parts , it just ai n't gonna happen
899,i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes , but i have to admit i 'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i 've baked from it so far . i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter . i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture , but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and does n't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter . so i was a little skeptical , and then reading through the recipes , although they are very clearly written , there are n't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes . the book already assumes a level of competence . i made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie , the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie , and the fudgy brownies . all three recipes tasted delicious , so i ca n't complain there , but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes , and both the cookies spread too much - - way too much , and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies . i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results , so right now i 'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up . i think it 's okay for a " base " cookie recipe book , but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients
900,my daughter ( 13 ) and i tried the number devil together . she has add and has difficulty with math . we found the intro to be too long and the games boring . this game did not keep her attention at all . we also tried math blaster and would recommend that game instead . i am glad others have found this game helpful unfortunately it didnt for us .
901,i just finished watching callie and son . i got my copy from the dollar store and it has another movie ( power passion and murder ) with michelle pfeiffer in it as well.. . it really was n't that bad , considering the price i paid . lindsay wagner is actually the main character and i think she did a great job , as did most of the actors in this film . the only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to . with a bit of editing and a bit better script , it would have been a great movie ! the end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying.. . i 'd recommend it for someone to watch once , but i would n't pay more than i did for it . the dvd quality is really poor , the sound fades in and out , but for what it was , a bargain bin cheapy , i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it .
902,the only reason i picked up this album was the name norah jones . i was expecting to hear her at the forefront , and i did n't really . to be honest , i was hoping to hear more of what she sounded like in come away with me and feels like home . if you 're looking for norah jones , this is n't really the album you 're looking for
903,i had high expectations for this book , but i was disappointed . it concentrated too much on digital systems , rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment . i lost interested in the last 1 / 3 of the book , and could n't wait to finish
904,the edward scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores . i truly believe this is danny elfman 's best score and believe me , he 's done some great scores ! the music is so moving . the childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet , beautiful film . even people who have n't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials . a must-have for any danny elfman and / or tim burton fan
905,honestly , i do n't know how much more they can improve adobe acrobat . it is an excellent product , and a god-send for electronic file management . i upgraded from version 6.0. the only problem i had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , and files seem to " print " to it much more quickly than version 6.0. i do not utilize the " one-button " feature it provides in ms office and other programs . i try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible , because my previous experiences showed that they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i do n't come close to using all the features of acrobat , but for my needs , it far surpasses anything else i 've tried ( or researched ) . if you 're having problems with version 6.0 , or have an older version that you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i do n't foresee ever needing to upgrade acrobat again
906,i just purchased this album , my first misfits album and every song on it rocks ( i especially like where eagles dare ) . i just bought two more albums , walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait . my only complain is the sound quality . it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more real too . metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same .
907,maybe because i ordered a " medium " . it works fine otherwise . i recommend it
908,this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
909,this is humor ? when does the humor begin ? is it close to the end cause i reckon that this ai n't funny . maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone , i reckin
910,can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music ? ive listened to many bob dylan albums , and every one is a gem . freewheelin ' is my favorite , but so what ? it does n't matter which ones we love , because we all know what bob dylan 's worst record was , and its saved . im not one to question this man 's beliefs or anything like that , bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe , but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is ? could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith ? almost certainly not . but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain
911,this epilator by emjoi does not work without the cord attached - the motor is too weak . in addition , the only disks that work at all are the two on the ends - the middle disks , since they are inset from the top , never reach the hair . i had to return this item , and i would not trust or recommend any item by emjoi . extremely poor quality , and does not work as promised
912,while some would call orange and acme " studio " albums , suggesting that they lack originality , but they have rythm . i would call myself a big jsbx fan , i play orange and acme constantly , however i feel that this album is a little too much free form , and free noise for the everyday listener . i would recommend that anyone interested in jsbx start with acme and then move on to orange to develop an appreciation for jsbx , because it is a rather acquired taste
913,i am satisfied with the product . for that matter i know it before i bought and i am satisfied with it . the only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet . still i would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety
914,with season 4 the series starts to slide a little . i do n't think the show is weaker , it 's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already ? look , i love the godfather one and two , but three is just not as good . the total time it takes to watch the first two godfather films is a little over 5 hours ! that wo n't even get you through season one of the sopranos . i hope i speak for everyone out there when i say that as good as the sopranos is , it will never come closed to the godfather movies . so i guess it is just starting to get old . i will certainly be watching the finale episodes , i just hope it is n't too big a let down . for those who are interested the dvd set has great transfers , but few interesting extras
915,this is the best book written by stephen king ! i 've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before i die
916,if you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of chinese , stay away from this product . rosetta stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven ( the critical language learning years ) , but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use . the object of the " game " is to match a mandarin phrase ( said aloud and written in pinyin ) to a poor , pixellated photo . for example , in the first section of the first lesson , you are shown a ball , an airplane , an elephant and a horse . a phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo . it gets much too complicated after that . basically , it 's a pure guessing game for most of the time . i gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews . i thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance , but i feel as though i wasted hours and hours . i can remember only two or three words from the entire experience . although i have spent fewer hours on pimsleur 's mandarin audio lessons , i am able to recall many , many more words and phrases . although pimsleur 's is n't perfect , it 's definitely the best choice for a beginner ( along with a solid chinese-english dictionary ) . if you do not know well the basics of mandarin , this software is completely useless . buy pimsleur 's instead
917,this was an excellent sophomore season for a great series
918,this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes . yes , it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment , but not enough to watch this film . it could be a cure for insomnia , though . fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed . you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen , and it 's really just very boring . all those fans of johnny depp : be particularly warned . he may have co-star billing , but blink and you 'll miss him
919,i was raised in virginia and never understood the details of the battle of yorktown . now i see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together . immediately after finishing this book i returned to yorktown with an entirely different understanding . i could relive the battle as if i had been there during the war . it was fascinating ! i never learned this from history books . male age 60
920,this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash . it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro . this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly . it snaps on and off easily . angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill . i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting . it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective . much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser
921,the foil is a bit misleading , because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves ( under the zipper ) the timmer will catch you and it hurts , a lot . the foil can only be used on straight surfaces . the two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle . if you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer... . well , be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa
922,this book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every american president . each individual section includes a brief summary of the president 's successes and failures while in office . the " secrets lives " aspect includes a description of his temperament , character and personal habits . for example , john adams is said to have been vain and irritable , while frankin pierce is depicted as an alcoholic . also much oddball trivia is mentioned , such as that george washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood . the biographical information is at least somewhat educational , especially on the lesser known presidents such as millard fillmore and zachary taylor . but most people who study history will already known much of what is written here . the truth is that o'brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials . but rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few books , such as " the reader 's companion to the american presidency , " and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining . also o'brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars . however , what i found most disturbing about this book is o'brien 's tone and attitude . his so-called " humorous style " is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents , especially those he dislikes . for example , he jokingly suggests that andrew jackson had " some unknown frontal lobe damage " . i have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president . in fact , i disagree with much of jackson 's presidential agenda , especially his bigoted policies directed against american indians . however , i also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that o ' brien uses . overall , i found the book to be juvenile , mean-spirited and overly negative . there are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there . so do n't waste your time on this one .
923,i first saw this movie when i was a kid . it left a good impression . i am now nearly 50 and a cat came to live with me . my first female cat . i named it mewsette in honor of judy garland 's character in the movie . i then searched for the movie on the internet , found it , bought it . while it 's not as good as it was when i was a kid , it is still amusing
924,the default supplier for this item is adorama . they have sku numbers mixed up on the back end , so they will ship you the hp 6221 dock instead . will not work with the r series . they do not even carry the actual hp 8887 dock . huge hassles , so click on the new and used link and buy directly from amazon . it 's a few dollars more , but at least you get the right item
925,most people ca n't get enough of this movie . i even own it on laserdisc . when i saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on dvd , i had to have it . i am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality . it lookslike there was just a transfer from vhs to dvd . there does n't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality . i recently saw it on hdnet movies and thought it looked much better . do buy this movie because it is an all time classic . do n't buy this movie if you think that the 20th anniversary edition is going to get you anything better
926,easy to learn , takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you do need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities are n't that great . very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash , though , and there 's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken ( not so great for fast action shots , even though it touts a " sports " mode ) . it 's a good beginner 's camera , a good pocket-style camera , but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit .
927,the strange and baffling career of cuba gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of denzel 's training day . unfortunately , cuba 's not denzel and this movie is way below the quality of day . filled with enough foul language to fill the pacific ocean , the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie , filled with bad cops- --where 's the good ones ? clifton collins jr. , so good in capote , is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of cuba who is going to testify in internal affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust . all though this cuba swaggers like a rap star and collins has to try and act tough with him . there 's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film
928,this is the only energy bar that i have sampled more than once ! the hooah ! energy bar works faster , lasts longer , and tastes better ! ... both flavors ! ... go army !
929,i upgraded from the canon digital rebel ( grey body ) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level . one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation . i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall
930,the author keeps referring to the lds church as a cult . by definition a cult is : a religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false , with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian , charismatic leader . in christ 's day many would have considered his movement ( christianity ) a cult by definition and now it 's the largest religious form of worship in the world . so let mormons do their thing . there 's upwards of 12 , 000 , 000 of them now so i guess they 're not a cult anymore
931,this package is very complete and easy to use . took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts , et . a lot of the tools are intuitive and simple
932,do not buy this book . this author belives that he can cure dyslexia with his mind 's eye . you can not cure dyslexia you just have to learn a different way from the norm with the right tools such as an orton-gillingham based program . i bought this book by mistake not looking carefully at the author .
933,the quality is excellent ! use it to go out of the digital cable box strait into the computer . pinnacle software is easy to use and edit with and if you have a dvd burner , makes great menus . i have bought and returned well over 5 rca capture devices and this is by far the best . especially for $50 ! ! ! ! ! ! cant beat it
934,excellent movie that shows how families should be and how most african american families really are . big mama 's are always the most important component to a family . definitely a collector 's item .
935,philips sent me a reprogram plug-in that took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new standards . most of the low price aed 's use camaera batteries . my defibrillator has a long life lithium battary . i wo n't risk someone 's life on store-bought battaries . walt blankenshi
936,what a complete pain ! ..... we now use macs . however , i decided to take the california bar examination july 2006. the california bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by examsoft . presently , the software will only work on windows xp . moreover , the california bar examiners will not allow any macs , even the newer macs with the intel processors which require complete re-booting into windows . as a result , i was forced to upgrade my gateway laptop , a fine laptop as far as pcs are concerned , in order to sit for this bar examination . ( that , or purchase a new laptop , which was probably the point . ) thank god for gateway computer technical support as the microsoft folks are clueless : even though the warranty on my gateway laptop expired some time ago , gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than i can possibly discuss here . conversely , microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected . ..... i suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software ( any new software ) will only work with the newer versions of windows xp or vista , and since vista will be such a memory hog , consumers eventually will be forced to dump their pcs which cannot be upgraded , for new pcs . as for how the operating system actually works : a grade of fair . yesterday , the microsoft update website was down which , according to microsoft 's discussion website seemed to be a problem with other window users as well . typical
937,i bought kayslays pain from the game about a week before it came out in most stores ( my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule ; ) . i read that it featured production by swizz beatz , kanye west , eminem and the heatmakerz . and as far as rappers go , most of the shady / aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists ( fat joe , ghostface killah , raekwon , scarface , memphis bleek and prodigy , etc ) . so i expected this cd to be a big step up from the streetsweeper volume 1 mixtape ( which i would give 3 stars at best ) . but for all the talent on this cd there 's not many good songs . i thought the production was pretty weak . some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west , swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland . if you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made , grab this disc . if your looking for good music leave this one alone
938,it is wondeful software . simple , easy to use , user-friendly , and very accurate in the pronunciation . buy this cd . do n't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster 's website . also try the medical dictionary . it is as equally superb
939,this is the worst ripoff of a major literary work i have ever seen . it takes colossal gall ( to say nothing of immense bad taste ) to take the bare bones of a dostoevsky novella & tack on every possible bodice-ripper cliche in movies & then try to interweave dostoevsky 's own personal travails as narrative interstices . all done with no flair for nor flavor of the original . the acting is strictly mid-20th century nyah-ha-ha masterpiece theater while the casting is about as suitable as ray winstone in his infamous henry viii turn . i got this just to see the great luise rainer . now i will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed
940,this is the slowest . operating . system i have ever used . the first time i installed xp home , i did n't see what was so bad about it , but when we tried installing it on our new gateway machine , it imedettly slowed all system operations down to a crawl . even my brother 's laptop , which is a very fast machine , has xp pro , and it randomly slows down . do n't get this operating system . it 's slow , buggy , and expensive
941,when i first purchase this album the first time . it was exceptional then and it still is . exceptional and gifted group these ladies rule the early 90's . some of my favorites free your mind , my lovin , it ai n't over till the fat lady sings , just to name a few . envogues voices all of them work masterfully together they way a head of their time . as far as female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups as supremes , labelle , tlc the had allot orginiality and appeal that drew people to them because of the voices and their orignal material . they are trendsetters . please go buy this cd . i will buy it again myself . i have the cassette . i need the cd for my collection . i know they came out with a new album hopefully this will be a great album as well . go envogue g
942,the charger really did what it was supposed to do . i have an li-10b , so i was still some what worried that it was n't going to do the job , but it did . i also liked that it was small so you can travel with it anywhere .
943,i have used microsoft works on numerous computers over the years and find it has the best and easiest programs to run . easy to understand and use for alot of different applications . i have used word and do not care for it .
944,in the early 60 's etta james was to r&amp ; b what patsy cline was to country . she could cross over and yet remain true to her roots , and that 's only one part of a nearly 50 year career ! from the velvety cross over soul of & quot ; at last&quot ; to the hard driving memphis soul of & quot ; tell mama&quot ; , this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today . she ranks right up with aretha franklin as an influential vocalist . i took far too many years to discover her power . if you have n't given her a serious look yet , stop wasting time and begin here
945,i love love tegan and sara and when i found out this was one of their favorite cds i have to admit....i think i was devastated . i just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse.not just not enjoyable...unbelieveably horrible . i think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music . do n't make your ears go through this much pain
946,i have a braun 8995 shaver which is fairly good but upon reading the reviews i just had to try out the panasonic and i am v impressed . dry it shaves v slightly closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too , a v close shave in about 2 minutes . i keep stroking my face to feel the smoothness . i dont use the cleaning station , i just rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil and cutters but with the results i am getting i am well pleased
947,do not buy this ! ! ! it does not work " as seen on t.v. " we were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it . would not cut a tomato , onion , carrot , apple only a cucumber . complete waste of money
948,i like to use the wet wipes , they 're good products . i gave only 2 stars because the package was n't packed well . i received the package this week . all seals of three boxes were broken , lids fell off , and the wipes were everywhere in the package , they were dried up , but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet , and it almost fell apart . what a mess it was !
949,like others , mine will review pictures but shuts off almost immediately when in i turn it on in still mode . bought in december 2005 , it is now not working . it is scandalous that so many of us have the same issue and sony is not addressing it . sony should be forced to recall these cameras .
950,i was rather disappointed in mr. peterson 's work . he dwells much too long on trying to convince us of & quot ; the problem&quot ; . nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload ! even after wading through the numbers and graphs , i am still skeptical of his conclusions and would caution readers to do further research . certainly the baby boomers are an aging bulge in the population of the us and will create some challenges . however , the author fails to mention the & quot ; echo boom&quot ; ( baby boomer 's children which are equal in number ) and he glosses over the impact of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every year . both of these facts will & quot ; soften&quot ; the impact of the & quot ; gray doom&quot ; that mr. peterson tries to create . i just do n't anticipate the tremendous problem of which he tries to make us aware . but i did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth control will have on our future . another disappointment was very little discussion of aging trends and buying habits . despite these shortcomings , i enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and the impact of aging populations
951,it was suggested by amazon.com that i buy this product since i was purchasing a canon powershot s2is digital camera . not knowing any better , i bought it . it does n't even work with this model camera . i bought a memory card reader instead at a local store & bypassed the need for an adapter altogether
952,xitel inport deluxe does what it says it does . you can plug in any rca aux connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer . it 's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers i will point out its minor drawbacks . first , audacity , the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit . however , i do n't know if it will freeze up on your computer . second , if you are thinking about buying this product to turn lps to cds , into most lp players do n't have rca aux plugs and you 'll need to buy an addapter . ( what they do n't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky . ) finally , the manual could use more detail because some of the important features were n't mentioned . if you do n't mind these drawbacks , you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product
953,this product was nothing short of miraculous for me . i 'm in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since i hit my teens...and while i have used various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and rosacea ( which started about age 40 ) , including retin a cream , topical and systemic antibiotics , and every sort of over the counter cleanser , these treatments helps but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as i aged . i 've been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it 's been in many years....i had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it . caution - i 've never had any benzoyle peroxide sensitivity . people who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably wo n't have the same kind of experience i do . bp creams have always helped , but were not as effective as this mask , which really gets down in the pores . i use it heavily . i apply it either before i brush my teeth or before i get in the shower . it is cool and refreshing . i usually let it sit as a mask for a few minutes before i rinse off , although sometimes i use it just as a cleanser when my skin needs freshening...like after i 've walked through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke . it leaves my skin very , very clean , and *soft.* i have never had any dryness or irritation from this product at all...indeed , my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time . the dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me . it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin . working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty , dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out . now before cleaning or working i will actually put a bit of this mask on - wne i am done , my skin is none the worse the wear for the activity.. . i stay clear and smooth . i guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria . i do not have serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life . the benzoyle peroxide mask has ended this trouble for me . i simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth , and wash it off . no prescriptions , no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules...just perfect skin for me . amazing ! ! !
954,this is not a fad diet . this is a simple , straighforward and helpful guide on how to eat . puhn 's style is friendly and upfront . i read this book over two years ago , and my eating habits will never be as random and damaging as they used to be , because the principles described are easy to implement . great book
955,works fine . like several other office packages lacks database program , access
956,i respect everyone 's opinion in here , and i 've tried so hard to love this album because i love pink floyd and i see how everyone calls it a classic . but i just do not get it . i highly overrated album imo . very childlike and underdeveloped , but maybe that is its charm ? i see 2 very different pink floyds and i have to say i never got into syd 's style . matilda this , lucifer that . the gnome ? come on . astromony domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen i 'm sorry to say . i 'm sure you 'll say a true floyd fan would love this album , well maybe that 's true . but for me , when waters and gilmour were together , that is the true floyd imo . and their reign started with meddle and ended with the wall . a brilliant 6 album run ( meddle , obc , dsotm , wywh , animals , the wall ) . for serious collectors , this is a must have and i 'll give it 2 stars , but stay away if you expect another ' wish you were here ' purchase , pre-gilmour can be a tough listen .
957,i have to say that i have been converted . for over 15 years now i lived with a razor . i have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too . i am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon . i have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade . i have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the gillette brand is the best type of razor , but now i find it 's not the best shave . i used an electric shaver several years back , it was one of the top of the line norelco with the incorporated gel . it gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs ; i ended up having to shave as normal . - -true story- - i am a manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item i was marked bad was my personal appearance . not that i dress bad or not wear deodorant , but that they felt i did n't shave often . ( i shave at the very least every other day , usually every day ) . so i felt i had to so something about it . i researched electric shavers thinking i could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer . i found that panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had . the instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut . i have been using it for almost 30 days now , and i will not live without it . i have never had this close of a shave before . i can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow . my fiancé has found a new love for touching my face , and i seem to be getting more kisses too ! during the first 2 weeks i had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old gillette , but today officially i was able to through my gillette away for good . ( my boss has even asked what i am doing different and when i told him , he went out and bought one too , he also loves it now . my fiancé said she would leave me if i stopped using the panasonic , it 's a good thing panasonic has been around for decades ) so , i am raving about his product , but every good has its bad.. . what the bad ? well , it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave , but for the amount of time i am planning to use it and the money i am saving from buying razors every month , i can handle that . the cleaning system is very good , but it takes very long to clean ( 2-3 hrs ) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles . the cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week . i have not gotten to that point yet , but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash . i just end up using the base for the drying cycle , which is an option . the batter is very good . in the month i have used it , i have charged it twice but it really did n't need it as it said the charge was good . overall.. . excellent product . could there be a better shaver out there , maybe , will i ever know.. . at this time , i am not worried about it , i am very satisfied with this panasonic , and do n't think it can get any better . this product does not include the cleaning base . i do recommend it as even if you do n't use it to clean the razor , you can use it to dry it , it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying . but , if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor , this is it !
958,after two months my conclussion was that i could see no change what-so-ever . typically neutrogena is quality , but not this time . now you ca n't say you were n't warned
959,i bought this for my wife so she could pull out the camera , turn it on , and take a nice photo . flash works well , unlike some reviews i 've read . battery life appears to be fine also . this is a small , light camera , measuring 3 1 / 2 " wide , 2 1 / 4 " tall , and 3 / 4 " deep when turned off . not exactly a credit card , but likely as close to one as you 're gonna get . camera opens up instantly , takes a nice photo whether with or without flash , battery life appears ok , and controls are easy to use- -either in figuring them out or using your fingers on them . nice big screen 2 1 / 4 by 1 1 / 2 , so you can easily see what 's going on- -a nice plus . this camera also has a nice " reminder " listing on the right of the display , so you can see flash setting ( on , off , etc. ) , iso setting for those of you that use that , and very nice way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus , self-timer , antishake , iso sensitivity , white background ( am i losing you yet ? ) , and so on . one point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely , so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera . i 've gotten some nice pictures with this , with and without flash . a nice pick . why not 5 stars ? cuz i 've also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices , although for the price this camera is fine and it 'd be one i 'd buy again , but it is n't the equal of dig cams with 6x optical zooms , separate iso settings , and all those other techie things that , frankly , are n't that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating . do buy a carrying case , as i have done , so the camera does n't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small . i do n't have any " special fear " about this but it 's also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into , so why not do it ? as in all my reviews , i have no financial interest one way or the other in what i review . also , do n't forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix , and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed . consider these additional costs , but also consider these additional costs apply to any camera you buy .
960,it 's just like the hit tv show ! in fact they probably got the idea for the tv show from this movie . actually i thought it was more of a comedy than anything . i saw it on the " we " network . it 's worth the price if you feel like buying it .
961,this is probably the worst war related movie i 've ever seen . i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two . time spent watching this film is time you 'll never get back and have nothing to show for it
962,any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission . these pieces , each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem , remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for & quot ; new age&quot ; . sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully-crafted music weave its web...it 's & quot ; feel good&quot ; music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor
963,from the manic whirlwind prelude to the shocking cake and sodomy , portrait of an american family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable . cake and sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures , lunchbox is told with a twist of humor , organ grinder is pleasing vocally , cyclops is addictingly wild , get your gunn is catchy ( if not overly insulting ) , dope hat is great and fierce , and my monkey is hysterically enjoyable . snake eyes and sissies is another winner , easy to get lost in . the rest all work to varying degrees , though not as appealing . every song on this album is worth listening to , from fast paced and rock style to techno overload .
964,more like a diary of some of tom 's successes ( and he has had many ) but only a few anecdotes . buy one of tj cloutier 's books ( or slansky 's ) for much much more insight
965,i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this album i do not like this albu
966,the flash works very well , i do wedding photogrphy so i need a good flash . it works great . i am very happy with this product
967,too lisa loeb for me . sorry . maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics
968,i have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and i think it is superb ! ! i now know that the alien movies rock ! the tone of the music fits the movie . i especially like & quot ; ripleys them&quot ; because it reflects on what has happened with ripley through-out the movie . the cloning , learing , remebering and also meeting her clones . i would also like to say that the movie was excellent aswell . the cast did a great job , acting their hearts out . jean-pierre jeunet should be proud of the music and his film.so if you are n't an alien fan , you sure as heck will be after you listen to the soundtracks ! ~ jenna
969,i 'm not sure what to call this cd other than genius . this was the first cd i 've heard from sonata arctica and it 's still my favorite . i 'm not really really big on power metal / epic metal , but i defintely enjoy sa and kamelot . with that said , i think this cd can even entertain those not interested in power metal . my friend enjors radio rock and rap , but after hearing me play this cd where we work , he begged me to make him a copy . towards the actual cd , i 'm not quite sure i can put what 's in it into words . songs like silver tongue and broken have a very distinct , unique sound . the ballads , draw me and the misery are both superb efforts , each making the listener feel tony kakko 's pain . my favorite song would have to be a dead heat between the misery and gravenimage . the keyboardist in this band works in overdrive in each song . he plays fast , and keeps the melody in each beautiful and interesting ( and lighthearted at times ) . the guitarist plays very fast when he needs to , and the right power chords other times . he 's quite good . overall , the sound they eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking . they do a great job . the lyrics seem much better than older releases ( english lessons ? ) but still can be a bit odd . " ...with long haired drummer in band " springs to mind . still at least they write about mundane things.. . i love kamelot , but the knight in shining armor routine will get old eventually . anyway , the vocals are very well done , he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite well , too . ( they 'd make queen jealous ! ) overall , i ca n't praise this cd enough . every song is an adventure , none of them a tedious or unnecessary one at that . i would say that anyone could enjoy this cd , but i 'd first recommend it to those who are tired of the american screamfest metal that 's going on today . then i 'd recommend it to power metal fans , and so on . simply put , this is one of the best cds i own . give it a chance
970,while bumble and bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products , this conditioner ( and i might add shampoo by the same name ) was a real disappointment . using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there was n't even a pleasant scent . do n't know where bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one . i 'm saving my $$$$$ for lush and frederic fekkai
971,i have gotten better results with sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price...like less the $15 shipped
972,p.d. james ' mysteries rank as outstanding entertainment . this cd featuring roy marsden as adam dagliesch is excellent . it has well developed characters , a complex plot involving actions that took place years before , and scenes in both london and on england 's coast . i highly recommend this product
973,first , this is a big and cumbersome... . but second , this is the best foot spa . got it for the wife and had to try it myself . i am a wuss when it comes to super hot temps and i had to ease into the heat , it stayed hot the entire time . the jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless ( just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you do n't have to move an inch : ) ) . the rollers on the bottom are nice too . it gets loud when on high-jets mode , but nothing to grand . fast shipper , would recommend
974,what do you do when the world is coming to an end right before your very eyes , but no one seems to believe you ? that is the concept facing dr. thomas more , distant relation to the famous / infamous saint thomas more , in walker percy 's novel " love in the ruins " . the united states is at a time of crisis , but few seem to understand the implications of the events unfolding around them . it is up to dr. more , who knows how to diagnose the problem , but not necessarily treat it , to try to prevent the chaos from happening . the story begins on a hot fourth of july , with doc staking out the abandoned howard johnsons motel in town . in three separate rooms he has cocooned his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows is going to happen ; an event that could very possibly bring about the end of the world . the novel then shifts back in time to the three previous days , tracing doc 's journey that led him to seek refuge at the motel . the reader learns that he has created a ontological lapsometer , a sort of " stethoscope of the human spirit " , through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a person 's soul , and finally discovers how to treat it . meanwhile , there is a revolution brewing ; the bantus and love children are ready to take over what the white man has destroyed , if a major catastrophe does n't befall everyone before that can happen . " love in the ruins " is a truly southern novel , crafted through percy 's intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a trademark of great southern writers such as percy and flannery o'connor . the reader must suspend disbelief as to the events unfolding , even though they are frighteningly realistic , and not so far-fetched in this present day . percy 's hero doc more is an antihero on par with those of hemingway ; flawed , prone to drink , forever chasing after women who are wrong for him . this novel is his coming-of-age , in a sense , because doc learns what it is he wants out of life , and how to best achieve that . subtitled " the adventures of a bad catholic at a time near the end of the world " , " love in the ruins " is a deliciously funny and poignant look at a near-apocalyptic america
975,whenever my eczema flared up , my friends would tell me i 'm too stressed out . i did n't feel that way , not much more stressed out than usual , so the timing of the flare ups and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing . after reading this book , however , i recognized it 's much more than just the simple stress - more deeply rooted issues i 've apparently held for a long time . i had vaguely suspected this may be the case , but did n't know how / where to start . this book gave me the guidance to do that on my own . i agree with 3 other reviewers completely . i no longer feel helpless and scared when i can feel my skin starting to flare up . i am not yet free from eczema , but knowing what may be the underlying cause of it , and how to calm it down , i have much stronger sense of being in control of my skin , body and my life
976,broke the day after i got it . but when it worked i loved it
977,i was trying my hardest to be creept out , but like someone said , it read like a pre-teen novel .
978,the quiller memorandum takes place back during the cold war . it represented a time and place in history that was true at that time . it accurately depicts an era that is now gone , that some of us lived through . the movie , by today 's standards , is a little disjointed and incomplete.it jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there . some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60 's or 70 's in order to get a g or gp rating . as a result of those incomplete or cut scenes , part of the movie makes no sense . the movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author 's original book . the most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score , including matt monroe 's " wednesday 's child " . i was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later . perhaps wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again . quiller must have gotten lost on his way home !
979,with in the first 4 days and only 3 uses my bottom plate was already flaking ...it catches your hair and the only to get it out is to pull which does hurt ....it works ok the first couple of times but i find i am scared to put it on a high temp cuz i dont want it to flake so if you have 30$ and you want this product keep saving and get a better one ....this product is not worth your time
980,i bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the smartmedia ( which only lasts for about a month ) . i would have to say that i am extremely disappointed , particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges . even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it 's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious , especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer . so blurry that i had to use photoshop to crop out the left and right sides . the right side was worse than the left making 1 / 8th of the entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one with a bad lens . in any case , no thanks , i 'll stick with my trusty old camera . i would rather pay for a new smartmedia card each month .
981,it opens with a tribute to h.g. wells and ends with an homage to jules verne.in the middle are 18 more stories that span from side to side of the sf spectrum and , even though they might not be all in the reader 's preferences , are sure worth reading , if not thought-provoking . talking about preferences , i ca n't help mentioning terry bisson 's & quot ; in the upper room&quot ; and damon knight 's & quot ; life edit&quot ; as the best of the lot . look forward for number 3 , and 4 , and. .
982,i am from india , and megadeth is one of the few metal bands with a huge following here.from the few bootlegs of live shows that i did manage to get hold of , this seems to be one of the best gigs ever.mustaine 's singing is as good as it gets live ( if you think it is bad , then you have'nt heard him elsewhere ) .but such minor foibles aside , the gig is f'in awesome.the setlist is almost perfect.the biggest pro is that most songs have been improvised.i love that.i used to hate the fact that megadeth played cd perfect versions of their tracks , which was not fun.i 'd rather listen to the cd with better production and singing.but here , they have really streched quiet a bit and given the audience , a stellar musical show.jimmy de grasso ( tho ' he looks a bit nervous in my opinion ) is unbelievaly tight.he looks like he is appearing for a test , when he 's playing the solo on she wolf ( you can see the tension on his face ) , but wotta solo....the sticks alsmost blur out.the sound and picture quality is great too.my only grouse is that the band has almost no audience interaction and there 's very lil bonus stuff on the cd....some soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would have rocked...they need to learn a thing or two from the ' tallica guys about this.but that apart...brilliant gig...a must for any metalhead
983,this movie is my all time favorite . my friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched it over and over .
984,daniel deronda is george eliot 's 1876 novel dealing with the rise of zionism incarnated in young daniel deronda . sadly but truly this is the first major english novel giving a positive view of the jewish people . deronda is raised by the wealthy sir malinger as an english gentleman . in the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a jew ; meets his mother and is the love object of two fascinating women . mirah lapidoth is the jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by daniel . her love for daniel burgeons as she comes to know and love the kind young man . gwendolyn harleth played by the brilliant acting of romola garai is the spoiled , impecunious husband hunter who weds the rich cad grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates ! she loves deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of psychological combat . like all bbc productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors . the scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear . this tale runs about four hours and is a joy.many american viewers may be dismayed at the slow , leisurely pace of british productions . please remember that these productions are based on long english novels which were published in several monthly parts . they are long but they are also wonderful explorations of the human soul . gwendolyn 's story is a bildungsroman in which she grows as a person . ditto for deronda who learns to take pride in his hebrew heritage . this is a worthy bbc production well worth the viewer 's time and money
985,the brababy does not function as claimed . the wholething came apart with the first wash . this device isway too flimsy
986,uhmm....yah.. . this is a low budget " film " , but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck . i 've seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art . it 's impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing sideline secrets ; for even untrained actors this is bad , it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie , and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there was n't supposed to be someone in the backgroung . i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom & a garage into what was supposed to be a club - and at the end of the home movie , i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive ( quite so too ! ) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever-so-hard to be a soft-core porn\thriller . in all seriousness , this thing gave me a horrible migraine . if you are stupid enough to actually buy this ( thankfully my roommate rented it ) invest in either a bottle of advil or a sledge hammer - you 'll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins.. .
987,this is a great movie that everyone should see . i 'm a conservative and so are all of my friends and they love this movie . we do n't see this movies as a " republicans are bad movie " thats dumb . this movie is just what a movie should be , funny and entertaining . we all love the songs because they are not only great , but true too
988,this is not the book to learn the basics of vbscript , but it 's exactly what i needed ; a good reference book . i got tired of trying to find syntax of commands and functions online . now i have it at my fingertips
989,i will not lash out against anyone , and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious , ostentatious egotism . that said , let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth 's solutions extremely difficult to accept . first off , it does n't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus 's morals in general terms . if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us , then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus 's codices . the key point here is that jesus 's older analects were deluded enough . his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale . jesus 's peuplade appears to be growing in number . i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations , circumvent any further litigation , and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death - - all by trumping up a phony emergency . his desire to control your bank account , your employment , your personal safety , and your mind is the chief sign that he 's a slaphappy caitiff . ( the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo " treatment " to cure my " problem " . ) perhaps i 'm reading too much into jesus 's ravings , but they do n't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests . jesus 's précis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent , noxious feudalism . that 's pretty transparent . what 's not so transparent is the answer to the following question : does jesus 's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities ? a clue might be that every time he tries , jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions . this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought , but for imagination as well . jesus 's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity . and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing . ( remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil ? ) jesus of nathareth has an agenda - - a political , social , and cultural agenda . and that 's all i have to say .
990,once again , the geniuses at universal have failed to give fans a decent collection ! although the single disc very best of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of robert palmer 's career , it omitted a few " must have " songs in favour of live material ( making for a 90% ok collection ) . earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from " redo " syndrome : the artist redoing a vocal track here , a drum mix there , re-recording entire songs elsewhere . this collection 's no different . in fact , there are many " remixed " and " redone " and " alternate vocal " mixes present ( something the very best of album avoided altogether , much to its credit ) . here , insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing . indeed , the classic and sequenced " sailing shoes / hey julia / sneaking sally through the alley " trilogy that marked the beginning of palmer 's breakthrough album is present , but the songs have been scattered apart from one another . thereby pondering the question : what were they thinking ? why was this done in this manner ? what do fans really want ? a 2 disc set that features the original material ( remastered , yes , but not remixed in any way , shape or form ) and a proper chronological sequence . done in this manner , such a set would properly honour one of popdom 's most memorable and talented individuals . what gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia , took the right batch of songs , but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner . this collection does no one any favours . stick to very best of until another bright light at universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection . that said , the way the music biz is these days , do n't count on it .
991,i purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last march . i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support . they went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up . well i followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been . so they said i should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it . then i sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there . they sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing . well i just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem . they never fixed the problem . mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son 's life before the age of 2. i called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor . she said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera . well i was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late august a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera , but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped . she said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera . i told i have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before i sent it in the first time . i started to cry that my son 's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when i got off the phone . the camera is worse than a disposable camera . do n't waste your time or money on this piece of junk . i recommend olympus . my olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk . i am planning on contacting the better business bureau regarding this matter . please do n't waste your time on this , like i have to ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could have forecasted this for me
992,the product appears to be informative and reasonably easy to use . it is very helpful just describing the issues that need to be addressed . provides for addressing some stuff we might rather ignore or avoid
993,i highly recommend this book . it 's wonderful ! desi arnaz is a great writer . he tells about his career and personel life honestly and with humor as well . he had a great voice as well
994,i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras . one kodak and another canon ( a70 ) . amazing product.. . pro.. . almost everything. . cons.. . no audio on video i definetly recommend the product for the price
995,i was just using this tape and ended it half-way through to write a review . the cueing stinks and is frustrating . i am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using firm tapes on and off for about 15 years . this one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing . stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is so frustrating . you want a work out where you actually work - not waste your time trying to read the instructor 's mind and falling all over the bench !
996,the topic of this book is very interesting : espionage in the revolutionary war . unfortunately , " washington 's spies " goes into so much nit-picking detail that , as the cliche goes , you ca n't see the forest for the trees . to really get anything out of this book , you 'd have to be a *very* dedicated revolutionary war buff . it did n't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader .
997,zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on mafia , and on this tour . its really hard to take , and i 'm glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on shot to hell . bls are a great group , but zakk 's persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles blessed hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the cds . stoned and drunk and funeral bell are critically altered to the point where i had to skip them . i 'm actually starting to suspect that zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect , because i ca n't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way . a few tunes sung this way i can handle , buts its total overkill on this dvd . the behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because zakk is a funny guy
998,i only wish i could return this camera . its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants ( what i do most ) and its manual focus is difficult ( very difficult ) to use . my much cheaper , and lower resolution , old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions . i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus . in addition , photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card . do n't buy this camera
999,overall , this is an extremely awesome concert . i am a big fan of dt , and like pretty much all their stuff . the performance itself is pretty good , although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and jordan 's keyboard solo . other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album . if they had done more special things , it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance , but would say they did okay as far as that goes . sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand , thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him , although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands , and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them . the special features are also pretty good , but i would not buy this concert just for those , backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves . overall , i did think it was pretty cool , and i would recommend buying it if you like dream theater or just their genre of music in general
1000,i 've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair ( and have it stay straight ) ! i am happy to say that i 've finally found something that works ! i 've had many different straighteners , and this one is by far the best . i have long curly hair , and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes . much better than the hour i 'm used to . plus , the straightening lasts . my hair stays completely flat all day , instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener . you simply ca n't get better than this !
1001,i was extremely disappointed with " after midnight " . the author , his widow , has written the book from her own life 's perspective , and there is sadly little about the true brad davis . his homosexuality , or perhaps bisexuality , is mentioned only in passing , and anyone in new york or hollywood that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his life . i guess a book written by his wife ca n't be expected to delve too deeply into this area , but even other interesting details - his drug addiction , his acting technique , etc. are only minimally suggested here . i wanted to put the book down after two chapters , but kept waiting for it to get interesting . i suggest the publishers retitle the book " my life with brad davis - the saga of a wife kept in the dark " , or something similar , to indicate to readers that this book is about susan bluestein , and tells very little about brad
1002,arrived on time and in terrific shape ! thanks
1003,this was one of the first books that i picked up after my divorce 17 plus years ago . i knew that i was giving these men all my love , but even with all the love i was giving them they were treating me like i did not matter . knowing there is a problem is the first step and what a huge step that is . after reading this book the light bulb went on with a bang and it has never gone off . i have struggled with relationhsip issues , but at least i know what is going on and with each relationship i got better and better until i got it right . i learned i had to read the signs that i chose to ignore for some many years . i have been in a healthy relationship now for 8 years with a man that shows me his love ( along with telling me ) and treats me the way i deserve .
1004,eugene o'neill 's play " long day 's journey into night " is a pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play about his family . i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater , i did not enjoy reading this play . the tyrone family 's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read . i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion . the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends . no happy ending , no hope for the future , just despair . " long day 's journey into night " is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without . however , after learning more about eugene o'neill 's background , and the extent to which the play is based on his life , i began to have a greater appreciation for this play . o'neill did lead a very hard life , therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill 's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner . while o'neill 's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending , it was appropriate for the play as eugene 's own family never got a happy ending . i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family 's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue . at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal , loving family . the audience soon however , gets the suspicion that something is n't quite right , and that the family is tense . slowly the family 's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members , but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up . thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well , their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth . although i still believe " long day 's journey into night " to be thoroughly disheartening to read , the reader 's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill 's exceptional writing .
1005,you know i thought this would be a great cd but no it is a total piece of dreck except for ken nordine he is a god in spoken word , i wished i would have bought two coppies one to poop on and one to cover it up .
1006,being familiar with some adobe products , we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work . boy , were we disappointed . simply put , this tool is not so much a tool , but a hindrance . utilities such as transparencies , are not only difficult to make work properly , but hidden in non-intuititve locations . dialogs are non-standard , which requires getting used to strange layouts in design . while seeminly small for just a couple items i 've mentioned , multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is . as has been mentioned by plenty of other people , it is also slow . if you want a simple image viewer , find anything else - even freeware , as i have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load , regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time . while i could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product , i will simple reiterate what others had also said ; it is cumbersome to use , slow to use and load , un-intuitive with poor layout and design , and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility .
1007,probably would buy other camera if i could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash . it is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures . you have to learn how to be very steady with it
1008,this cd and the one entitled " night ranger 's greatest hits are almost identical , but are different in this way : " best " contains " i did it for love " . " greatest " contains , instead , " rumours in the air " and " restless kind " . the other 10 tracks on each cd are the same . so , which one to buy ? my choice is the one with the extra track . also , in my opinion , both tracks on " greatest " are better than the one on " best " . in addition , here 's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a true " greatest hits " or " best of " album that will contain about 15 or 16 songs . or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will include some rare tracks . night ranger fans would surely delight to see something like that
1009,this book has a wealth of information for any practitioner of yoga , from beginner to advanced . the content is concise and practical , and the poses are sequenced in a way that allows for a gradual and safe progression in the practice . there are also dozens of practice sequences given for both improvement and how to treat common ailments through yoga . the introduction is especially valuable , as it offers a no fluff in-depth commentary on the philosophical thought behind the asana practice . i pick it up again and again and am still referring to it after nearly 15 years of owing it . my copy is dog eared and loved , and was well worth every penny . an earlier reviewer mentioned that the photos and layout were not user friendly , and only gave the book two stars , which is a shame . this book was first printed in the mid 1960 's - over 40 years ago ! it was the first yoga book of it 's kind to ever be printed , and it 's content is timeless and as relevant today as ever . mr. iyengar even had to struggle with his then publisher to be allowed to include so many photos , as it was so expensive in those days to print such a book . i say hats off to the man who brought yoga to the west long before it was ready . he 's a pioneer and a virtuoso of his craft , and his marvelous work should never be over overlooked just because it does n't come in some glossy package fit for the masses
1010,this camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box . one mistake i made was to not take my own sd card to the camera shop and look at the output . i thought the blurry image i was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera . i 've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this . casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work . and point and shoot is definately not an option . i thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping . i 've taken over 200 pictures and i will not print any of them .
1011,bell harrah is so right ! this things is indeed garbage ! i have been using this things since march 9 , 2005 and there is very little difference in my hair . it still breaks , for goodness sakes , and where is the hard nails that is also suppose to result from using these pills ? ! it makes me wonder what the hell this thing is doing to my body , as it has not helped my hair and this month of may makes it 4 months i have been using . you 're suppose to see some huge changes within a month to 45 days , and not one damn thing has happened ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and the pills are so damn expensive ! . i really do n't have $57 to throw a way a month , so when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work . i agree with the previous reviewer-do n't waste your money
1012,if your a pacino fan this is for you one of his earlier films this deals with a lawyer not a crooked lawyer but a good mostly honest lawyer and all the things that a lawyer has goon through or could go through this is a instant classic and the story to the movie is excellent highly recomende
1013,ice cube is back for his 6th solo with the peace disc . this may be my favorite album from cube ( close with " lethal injection " ) . his lyrics are much different then his first few albums and the beats changed with tthe times but it 's still nice to hear from cube . with 13 songs , none ar ebad , 5 are ok , 1 is almost a classic and the rest are good . guests are on 4 songs so you still get enough cube to satisfy you . production is decent as well , chuckey thompson & one eye each do 3 songs , puff daddy , younglord , bud'da , battlecat , dr. dre , t-bone and charley bear all do 1 song . a must have album for fans of ice cube . #1 - 8.5 ( f / mc ren & dr. dre - - n.w.a. reunion ) #3 - 8.5 #4 - 8.5 ( f / jayo felony , gangsta from the comrads and squeek ru ) #5 - 7.5 ( 1 minute intro before he raps ) #7 - 8.5 ( nice beat ) #8 - 9.5 ( f / krayzie bone - - nice beat ) #9 - 7.5 ( f / mack 10 & ms. toi - - also on the " next friday " soundtrack ) #11 - 8.5 ( nice beat ) #12 - 7 #13 - 7 #15 - 7.5 #16 - 8 ( good beat ) #17 - 8 o'shea jackson - - b. 6 / 15 / 69 check all my review
1014,the best buy in the marketplace . it easily fits into my suitcase for travel...the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is
1015,this movie is by far one of the greatest movies ever made . you will laugh all the way thru it..and enjoy when things were so much simplier in hollywood
1016,installed this on my laptop and desktop computers . one installation was late in 2005 , the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006. both have tried to fail . the laptop will no longer do automatic updates . i can manually download and install the updates , but it is a bit of a hassle . the desktop will no longer download the symantec updates at all . i attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls , wo n't do it . the only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers . because of the problems , i 've run into several problems , mostly related to .cab files when i attempt downloads . i 've switched to avg and zone alarm - both free and they work
1017,this book was great . i especialy liked the chapter where bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker 's hoo-hah . priceless
1018,i 've only used the kit once , and it did what it was supposed to . no problems , everything went fine , and i intend to use it again within about a month . it should pay for itself very quickly
1019,this monopod does a great job for my camera . you have the quick , easy-off , it attatches to your camera by a screw , and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly . i wanted a nice , inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense . i have a canon 35mm , and i recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it , and i needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot . if i knew then what i know now , i would buy it again . nice product
1020,has anyone taken this formula during natural childbirth and does it help ? ? ? ? ? ? please respond
1021,i gave it two stars because it was great.. . when it worked . i got it sometime in january , and it lasted until about june . i take good care of my things , so i know its not me . it just suddenly *stopped* working . i 'm more than just a little miffed . i 've tried getting all different types of batteries - i 've tried letting it sit for a while . i 've taken it to my friend who works with cameras for a living and had him take it apart and clean it and all sorts of stuff . its dead . i just threw it away
1022,excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it . highly recommended
1023,i enjoyed the parts regarding the s.s. valiant , but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me . except for picard , who we of course know quite well from the series , the other characters were flat and uninteresting . we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week , boring . the whole & quot ; adversarial&quot ; situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong , and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard
1024,i 've purchased seven items from amazon in 2005 , so i 'm not a complete rookie . this item 's ad title includes the word " battery " in big , bold letters . i purchased this kit advertised with a " used price " , but " condition : new " . the ad picture clearly shows a battery . i had looked at several ads and did not read the individual seller 's comment " battery missing " in uppercase , though in regular font . to me , a missing part warrants more of a warning than a " comment " . that 's my " lesson learned " , but i still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big , bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing . lesson learned : read the whole ad for the specific seller , especially the " seller 's comments "
1025,a quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running . i 've been able to do most of the things i 've wanted to do with this program and it 's delivered on most of its promises . my wife loves it too . i have to remind myself that i 'm not an architect and this is n't a professional program , though . it does most things really well but it has some short comings . i 'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and have n't had any luck yet . although i 've net seen all tutorials , i 'm doubtful the program can do it at all . foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best . my planned home addition includes a home theater and i 've had to use work-arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls . ( which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator . ) but it has let me put in chairs , speakers , and a projector screen which makes the 3d views very close to what the finished product may look like . the framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose . so as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy . basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and i 've had a blast planning our addition . i ca n't imagine designing our addition / remodel without it . i would buy it again
1026,these are just ok , not great . i have 2 pairs of the clic readers and i love them . the sunglasses , however , are not as sturdy , the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and i just cannot endorse them . i am disappointed as i am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses . it 's a shame
1027,the quiet earth is overrated for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below . this movie is not the epic , thought-provoking , intelligent sci fi i was led to believe it was . it 's actually very overrated , and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or primer will likely be very disappointed . the first 30 minutes or so are jaw-dropping . i was really getting geared up for what i was sure was going to become one of my all-time favorites . the scenes of bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet , driving around a mall , the sun rising to the haunting score- -all unforgettable . the scenes where bruno starts to lose it , running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun , setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he 's their ruler , giving them speeches ( that 's why i deserve to be president...of the quiet earth...i 've been condemned to live ) are all great . after this point the movie starts to disintegrate , and quickly . the female character is highly irritating , so much so that i think i would have ditched her and looked for other survivors . api is also highly irritating , and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle- -my thumbs were pointing down , way down . something needs to be said about the ending of this film . so many people have said that it 's " deep . " how is it " deep ? " how is it deep when it 's just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really does n't have anything to say ? let 's examine this . many people argue the following ( and if they were correct the film would 've been much better than it was ) : the main character is a scientist who convinces himself that project flashlight resulted in " the effect " ( even though others here insist on calling it " the event " ) which made everyone else disappear . the main characters come to believe that " the effect " did n't snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened . but what if there is n't any " effect " at all ? what if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there are n't any people ? the scientist then convinces himself that " the effect " is going to happen again , and , understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers , daffy , annoying woman and a nutty , homicidal maniac , decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for project flashlight . he dies again and ends up on another world , one which this time does n't even resemble earth . the end . it would have been very clever if this was what was going on , if there really was n't an " effect " at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died . unfortunately , all the critics saying " they went to another earth where everyone else was gone " are forgetting something : the dead bodies ! i know there are n't a lot , but remember , there 's the radiation burn guy in the science station , and there 's the dead guy on the hood of his car , and the dead woman holding a cb radio , etc. if they went to another earth where life was absent , why are there dead people ? the real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out , that it does n't make sense , and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive . according to the people who worked on the film , " the effect " obviously did occur , and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies , again , at the exact moment that " the effect " occurs a second time . so at the end , " the effect " does occur a second time , which means the girl and api are history , and the scientist , as he again dies when " the effect " occurs , moves on one more time . another point that is made in the dvd commentary is that the film was made by a catholic , so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind . also highly irritating is that for a scientist , the main character is not very smart . he laments that he 's the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman . they find a nutty guy named api and then the three of them conclude they 're the last three people on earth ! what ? ! are they totally daft ? a scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city , more people than that throughout the rest of new zealand , and even more people in bigger places such as america , europe , and asia . that his first conclusion is always that " they 're the only ones " only demonstrates his stupidity . they come to believe that they all died at the same time , right when " the effect " occurred , and that that 's why they remained on earth . well , if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny new zealand , then many , many other people must 've died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world .
1028,the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd , the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars . this set was poorly put together , the shorts included are quite random , and buying this set would be a waste of money . each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters . first there is alfalfa , then buckwheat , spanky , darla , porky , mickey , stymie , then fatty - oh wait , no that is joe cobb only they did n't know his real name , then farina , and last phil macmahon - who you may be asking ? phil macmahon , the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938. still do n't know him ? maybe that is because he was n't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection . disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day . dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot ; it is one of my favorite shorts from the series . however , it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score . derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series . it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races . the films themselves are very good . disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright . it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents . it is a total disaster . just like in reunion in rhythm , one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry . the film has been seriously cut ; there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length . the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted . the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores , but it works . there are sound effects too . sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train . it is a very cute film ; farina is especially funny in it . the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood . the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video 's soundtracks . the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers . it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship . when it sinks , they find a real one to destroy . this short has also been cut ; there is no opener for it either . it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it . disk three opens with mary queen of tots . it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang . she dreams they come to life , and when she wakes up , she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life . this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set . it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though . the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters . the print on this one is not bad at all . the last film is school 's out , a talkie featuring a different cast . it is a film featuring miss crabtree , the new teacher . the picture is good ; it seems to be the one from cabin fever . disk four begins with bear shooters . this is a less than great film . the print is great ; it is the one from cabin fever . our gang follies of 1938 is a great film , very funny , long , and exciting . it features the later talkie cast . waldo 's last stand is a film from the later mgm years , a lesser film that seems forced . it was also released in a 5 part rascals set . disk five is the extra features dvd . it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show . on it , some of the silent gang are reunited . joe cobb , jackie condon , farina hoskins , johnny downs , and mickey daniels are featured . the documentary called kid stuff really does n't have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview . other child stars like jackie coogan , judy garland , shirley temple , roddy mcdowall , and ron howard are focused on as well . the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain . many of them have been available cheaply for years . the only reason a fan might want to see this collection , the same reason i bothered , was to see the rarer silent films . however , the rest of the set is trash
1029,i was expecting a lot more from these two cd's . it teaches you a few items of food , basic words like " hello " , please " and " airplane " and even teaches you to ask " where are the suitcases " ... but then that is about it . i was really hoping for more.. . much more
1030,after looking into several reviews on blow dryers , i learned about the revlon tourmaline . all of the reviews were so positive . i 've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are . the placement could n't be better on the controls . the price was right as well ! blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive . a very good value
1031,i have used mcafee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product . i bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall ( zonealarm ) in my case . that is the only negative i have found so far . the mcafee firewall seems sufficient so far
1032,i 'm usually a very skeptical person and i do n't trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time . but these vitamins actually do work . it takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they work . so if you need something to help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show results . the only thing i hate about the product is the price . but if you have money and want help with growing your hair then you 're in luck . i 'm young and i do n't have alot of money so i ca n't buy these vitamins all the time . but if you have a steady cash flow then you 're in luck and they will totally help you
1033,i purchased a nikon for my first camera , i just loved how you can take it anywhere , fits handy in your pocket and perfect size . i could n't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo's . for my birthday i took over 100 photo 's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost . i was so devistated . the video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people 's faces . my friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo's . so maybe i just got the short end of the stick...but this was my first camera so its okay for starters...but if you love to take photo 's be full aware that on a low battery that it just might not want to hold them . a major plus i do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image ! that i 'll give 5 stars to...everything else i 'd have to say 2 stars !
1034,my little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie . he goes around acting like the characters from the movie ! he really likes harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending . he is also convinced that they should make a midnight madness 2 and let harold win the next time ! this is a great movie , with a young michael j . fox in it , and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie
1035,i was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back . however , immediately after opening the product , i tried to plug it in , as it does n't work without batteries being fully charged . unfortunately , this massager would plug in but did not start charging , and therefore , it could not be charged . i will be returning this item
1036,this is excellent..i like the ease of using it and the digital read out is great . i highly recommend this produc
1037,as i stated before , i have a fabulous thing called " digital cable " . one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on . i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off . sometimes that happens with " digital cable " , but it usually it will right itself in the end . as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore . i tried everything to fix it including switching channels , turning on and off the tv , and things of that nature . i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining , but even that was a wasted effort . i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs-width away from haymakering morris . well , even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far , when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance . i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this , because it might not be completely his fault . for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices , or it might be because it 's his first movie . who knows but howard 's mind was made up . " rumble in the bronx " was to be rented . from what i saw so far on " digital cable " , i possibly found a person i could call my mentor , when i enter the world of stuntmen . when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what ? the dvd was messed up as well , the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on " digital cable " . i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy , telling them this dvd was broken . i returned home again and tried to watch it . " what the heck ! ? " i yelled , " is the world against howard tuttleman ! ? " you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too . i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up . i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window ( i rented it on my father 's card so there is no recourse to me ) . after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica , i was still determined to see this movie . i ran up to best buy in troy , and i found a copy . i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version , hoping that it was a new pressing . i was happy with his answer and purchased it . well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop . i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights . finally , tuttleman will have his moment . well to keep this clean and short , let me say that , that night ended with a baseball bat , three ( 3 ) stitches in my hand , a broken window , and a hefty grounding-sentence ( we are talking weeks here ) . in conclusion , some movies ca n't be good , no matter how cool the stuntman , this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot . later .
1038,first they started out as nu-metal , then they moved onto metalcore , and now psuedo-death metal . it should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends , and after each trend dies , they just move on to another one . if my calculations are correct , expect a psuedo-black metal release . but , what about the musicians ? sure , they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot , then they have two guitarists...who like to steal pantera riffs , and then they have the singer , who , well , sounds just like all the rest . atleast they dont have the dj anymore ( oh wait , they do , nevermind . ) enough of my rambling , how does this untalented group of posers fair up ? well , image if mushroomhead went metalcore . ' nuff said . avoid
1039,this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film 's mood . i 'm not sure when this " score " was " written " , although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film . nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film . with this edition 's music , i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard , and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while . if you want an affective , edge-of-the-seat experience out of nosferatu , i reccomend another edition .
1040,this is my first digital picture frame , so i do not have anything to compare it against . i am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use , and i am happy with the resolution and the picture quality . the only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all , and as one other reviewer noted , i had to learn how to do things by trial and error . i also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images , it is not " saved " to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time . however , i like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next christmas
1041,never in my life have i seen a film dedicated to the subject of vichy france . i had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government . i assumed that the sorrow and the pity was strictly a documentary about the french resistance , but was pleasantly surprised by its depth . it describes the vichy of petain and laval quite thoroughly . you may recognize some of ophuls ' interviewees from the world at war ( such as edward spears ) , but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the ss . i assume he served in the charlemagne outfit . frankly , i was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face . his point that the slaughter of 1 , 600 french sailors by the english was a motivating force for him to join the germans was something i would have never considered . it seems inconceivable back then for the french to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than england- -given the competition- -but it is clear that anglophobia was rampant after " the rout " of may 1940. the most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists . it seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed petain ( at first ) and looked sympathetically to the nazis . the speeches , the newsreels , and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting - especially if you 're a history buff . i 'd rank this one right up there with hotel terminus .
1042,i tried with two sets of new batteries , the goggle unit flashed but no massaging action whatsoever happened . besides that , the design looks cheap and it feels very tight and uncomfortable to wear . avoid this item
1043,i think his debut had the best lyrics . this joint gets off to a good start with we still party and pretty much bangs till the end . his production on here is best described as " late 90 's roger troutman-esque g-funk " . geust stars like 2nd ii none , amg , suga free and el debarge get their shine on . top joints : we still party ( peter gunz and quik on the track ) quik jacks the verb song from school house rock . ( the jam ) so many wayz hand in hand you'z a ganxta ( quik refutes rumors that he was involved in biggie 's demise . also denounces reference to death in rap songs . ) i useta know her ( should be called i useta hit that ) speed medley for a ' v ' ( the p***y medley ) get 2getha again ( class of 91 , 2nd ii none , amg and quik triple team on this track . ) reprise ( medley for a ' v )
1044,this film seems to be known worldwide as a " chick flick " , from the romantic aspects of it , to the current anniversary dvd 's pink cover . i 'm an 18 year old guy who absolutely digs this film , especially due to the holly golightly character . after viewing this film for the first time , i developed a crush on the character holly ( kind of goofy , i guess , but it 's very hard for me to dislike a character like her . ) audrey hepburn played her to perfection . the film was also brilliantly shot by franz planer and directed by blake edwards . i love the film 's dialogue as well , it has a very realistic quality , and it 's so fun to hear the characters converse with each other . " breakfast at tiffany 's " is perhaps the best " date " movie ever conceived . this film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age .
1045,i 've seen it about 20 times now . it does n't get old . the faces , the moves and the lines of matthew perry are always fresh . my husband likes selma , a lot , so it 's a win win for both of us . they are great together . good stuff
1046,i have just purchased this cd ( the day it came out ! ) and from what i 've heard , it is amazing , surpassing ( but not replacing ) boulez 's earlier recording . if you are a fan of boulez , 20th century music , or music in general , this is a must get
1047,i gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift , we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy....not a good gift .
1048,this album is incredible . for me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life . an album that for months i played over and over . an album that i 've played countless times , that i have passed out to when i came home after a late night , that i have ran to , and worked out to , that i play at work for a pick-me up . it 's great . it 's filled with so much emotion and passion , from beginning to end its just brilliant , the entire album . the songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams . i love it . you have to buy this album . then buy their next self titled album . then play it and play it , and play it . it grows on you . i ca n't wait to see them live.. .
1049,this cd is not at all what it appears to be . they got other people singing and playing the music , so it 's not what you 're probably looking for . terrible misrespresentation . i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i used my other party cd 's or my guests would have left......and i would have held the door open.....not blamed them for leaving !
1050,as the other reviewers make clear , this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who " ruined " her . so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation . problem is , having just watched the movie , i am not convinced there is anything below the surface . prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities , the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one , and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy ( as fantasy it is ) . is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility ? not that i can see
1051,this is the same charger came with my digital rebel , however , i like to charge two batteries at a time . so , i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip . the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact , flat and easy to take along with you . it 's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with .
1052,in this movie we once again see mad max ( sans hot car ) wandering around in a post apocalyptic world until he discovers bartertown in the wasteland.mel gibson tries valiantly to channel such on screen loners as clint eastwood and john wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social skills . however he becomes a threat to the matriarch of the town by the name of aunty emteevee ( or something like that ) . then mel kicks a lot of butt in the process . this is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the outback opal mining town of coober pedy which i visited a few years ago
1053,*no spoilers* we had enough of lame japanese films . this new " wave " of horror movies like " the ring , " " pulse " and now " the grudge 2 " does n't seem to have an end . the genre is played out but that did n't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version . to understand this film- -which is nearly impossible until the end- -you would have to see the first movie . brief story : the film has basically three plots , but in a way they are connected to each other . the first plot is a follow-up of what happened to karen davis ( sara michele gellar ) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house . mrs. davis ( joanna cassidy ) asks her other daughter aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister karen . she travels to japan to bring sara home . now in japan , she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house , but something terrible is about to happen . the second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house . one of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we do n't know about . suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child . she tries to get out but the door jammed . they all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost . unfortunately , they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited . the third plot takes place in the us where a new family moves to an old building . a young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the " strange lady " that lives next door has something to do with it . people are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence . review : less scary and sillier than the original , " the grudge 2 " takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience . the movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them . we have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other . this time around the ghosts are outsourcing from japan to the us . they do n't care whether you visit the house or not . now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason . these ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way- -even a young little boy- -just to show their rage . the so-called scary moments are not scary at all . they are lame , mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version . what 's sad is that , this time around , the writers have to make the actresses show some " skin " to please the male teen audience . this is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie . in the technical department the movie does n't do a good job either . the editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion . we have three plots that are poorly mixed together . sometimes we are in japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the us . the photography of the film is identical to its predecessor , but that 's the only thing that resemblances the original . in the sound department , the movie will make you laugh . we hear sillier noises than the original . instead of getting scared , you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make- -we personally like the angry " kitty " sound . the verdict : a terrible sequel of a decent horror film , " the grudge 2 " could have been a straight-to-video release if it was n't for the beautiful sara michelle gellar . no scary moments but many funny ones- -unintentionally , of course .
1054,it is a great product and makes my husband 's face as smooth as a baby 's you know........................... .
1055,toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties . they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable . but , there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste . my fave song is ' is it for me' . it is hard to classify them though . it sort of deep and meaningful ( at most times ) pop rock . other good tracks include walk on the ocean , pray your gods and i will not take...etc . i regard this album and ' dulcinea ' as their two best albums
1056,yeah . it 's true . this movie is awesome . i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it
1057,if you love well written stories , great plots and captivating acting then this movie is not for you . i do n't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie , however there it is ! it was so boring and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes i had to turn it off . i do n't even want to know how it ended . the cast line up was great ! that 's the only ' positive ' comment i can make with regards to this movie . do not watch it . do not hire it . do not believe anybody who thinks it is good . the two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly ; get this , it was done in the missionary position ! avoid this movie
1058,this product may be good for something but it is not good for plucking your own face . i was very disapointed in it . the tweezers were hard to push together . the light was too narrow to be helpful . the product was hard to position is a way that the magnifier could be used . i tried to use it several times and always got frustrated .
1059,i could n't read past the second chapter . roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims . it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of " the bitter " . " your wives are your fields , so go to your fields as you like " is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran . i 'm not going to finish this book , because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic , oppressed " other " type of woman , thanks .
1060,wow ! there 's sooooo.. . much to like in this album it 's amazing . the music is mostly upbeat & very catchy- -making you want to ( & will if no one 's around ) sing along . the lyrics are fine , meaningful , & personally touching- -about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world , while people are still people with hopes , feelings , needs , desires , & all the rest of what makes people human . the lead singer , jennifer nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice ( though a bit twangy in style ) . she grabs you quickly for a wild ride- -immersing the listener in the musical story she 's telling . i bought the cd based on hearing baby girl & something more ( on the tv show vegas of all place ) . then i heard sugarland on the cma show- -winning awards as they so deserve . the range & variety of the songs on the album are good too- -from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring . virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles . yes , the style is their own mixture of influences- -the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds , which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive . and , the trio wrote all the songs on the cd- -with hall the primary author ( solo writer on one of them ) . how many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man ? i wonder if they are unique ? well , they are unique even if not in that respect- -how many bands include a mandolin ? . of course , country purists may not be happy with them , but the vast majority of listeners are . this has become one of my favorite albums , at the speed of sound . imho , it 's terrific
1061,ms. kulp has done a wonderful job , as usual , updating her classic book on raising a child with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders . this book is a must-read for anyone who loves someone with fasd
1062,bought it and it worked for like a month . now it just sits in my room doing nothing . i am going to look for the company information and try to get my money back . if you are going to get a shower mirror pay a little more and get quality
1063,this is the best review of the jfk assassination that i have seen . there is still a large " assassination industry , " which can afford to find documents that you have n't read and charge you with ignorance if you have n't read them , and find 15 more if you read them . this gives a common-sense overview that seems quite reasonable . i trust it . i am always willing to consider other opinions , but the balance of evidence has always indicated that oswald acted alone . it would be nice to have a new edition of this book. .
1064,the software is easy to install and easy to use . the " import prior year 's return " feature saved time in completing multiple returns . i completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature . i also discovered the " save as pdf " feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom i prepare returns . i have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year . the premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules
1065,based on other reviews here and comparisons to jellyfish , jason falkner and the beatles , i was expecting a lot better . instead i find this work very shrill and hard to listen to . is the guy talented musically ? yes . but his voice is mediocre and his songs really do n't do it for me . sorry but i feel the need to give an honest assessment so others wo n't be mislead by the breathless reviews here . i am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre
1066,this is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning . one does not need to love the results of these changes ( i personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it , even as i marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election ) to appreciate how clinton 's 1992 campaign , as seen in this film , changed the american political world . " war room " should be seen along with more recent documentaries ( like , for example , " staffers ' 04 " ) to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal ( to be elected rather than to govern ) . hopefully , it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless , mind-numbing , dumbing down assessments of candidate traits ( like " character " or " integrity " ) we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years
1067,i was really disappointed in this product . it worked great when i first got it . but before the first charge on the batteries wore out it stopped working . it was more expensive to return it or have it repaired than it was to buy a new camera . like i said , disappointed
1068,a good product but like a lot of microsoft releases , not everyone outside of microsoft is ready for it . check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with expression web . that is a problem i have run into . in fact some hosting services that support front page , have n't even come to full support of front page 2003 let alone expression web . you could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
1069,nearly two years of ownership and it has been a great purchase . i have no shame dorking up my drinking . use to ensure legal driving or for ill advised contests . also determine what at what bac memory gets spotty ( what point is there exceeding that ? ) . fun to call out big talkers who do n't suspect you are packing a lie detector of sorts . also useful to get people off your back who think you are too drunk to drive . pros precision to third decimal place . rare at this price at time of my purchase very repeatable with consistant deep breath small enough to take to bars in jacket pocket or cargo pockets . light for its size . cons innaccurate if sips have been taken within 10 minutes or so . true for all breathalyzers . drunk idiots have tough time getting it through their heads warm up / calibration time ~45 sec . another let down at parties but perhaps key to accuracy would be nice if it was more pocket sized chirps at you alarm clock style if above .08 " i know i 'm drunk , shut up !
1070,patton oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance . it 's because of comedy central mangling the dvd version . the show was originally broadcast on comedy central , and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials . the dvd has the original show , and then in the bonus section , it has " deleted scenes , " which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time . so , you can watch the time-edited show , or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out . but what you ca n't do , and what i have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do , is see the original full-length show in its entirety . so , cheers for patton , boos for cc . i wo n't be buying the dvd and that 's why .
1071,making ancient history entertaining ? for children ? ! ? you bet... . enhance your history studies by reading books that are written specifically to a child . great book complete with historical accuracy & lively illustrations . approximately 3rd grade reading level , interesting to even older elementary students . do n't rely on it for a primary source , but include it in a study of greece . nice book
1072,this is a good collection , 15 of supertramp 's best songs and the best single-disc collection of theirs you will find . the sound is great and there are no filler songs , here , they 're all great to listen to . highly recommended
1073,i typically do not read stories like this , but a neighbor had lent it to me and i figured i 'd check it out . the plot is n't bad , but the dialogue is another story . the writing was so unbelievably awful that i had to fight myself to finish it . phrases like " god damn , oh god , etc.. . " were repeated over and over again . i got really sick hearing about tess 's cute freckles and jimmy 's movie star looks / sex drive . the majority of the story line between tess and jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand . it was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing . i 'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book . not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from harlequin romances.. .
1074,the item pictured here is not what you will receive . you will receive a different model that has a different external and possibly internal design . most important is that the model you get will not have the little orange change filter indicator . this very important feature takes the guess-work out of when to change the filter . do n't buy this item from this seller if you expect to get what is pictured . thanks , pj-berk
1075,i read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the sedu . it took me a week to get the product and i anxiously tried it as soon as it arrived . i must say that the products is a dream come true . i am an african american woman and i have never been able to get my hair as straight as i am able to do now , not even when going to the salon . when i went back to work from the weekend , my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked ( because it was truly straight ) . i would recommend this to any woman . i have not been back to the salon in the last 2 months
1076,there are n't enough movies like this these days . family oriented ( centered actually ) , adventure with edutainmental attributes . great cast , great score , great ( albeit goofy ) story . people give this film too much credit for being implausible , which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true . if you 're looking for adventure and fun , thrilling characters in a family film , this is it
1077,i have been using this cord for about a year , and i had problems with its durability . it actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months , but then it started to fall apart . when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket , the thin plastic shoe ( where the flash is attached to ) developed a crack and eventually broke off , making it useless to mount the flash . i had to buy a replacement part from canon ( who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece ) . i flipped the flash carefully from then on , but then it still cracked ! ! i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic . so far , there is no response . a few months later , the cord , for some unknown reason , makes my 550ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode , and making the flash fire at full power , overexposing the entire image . i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera 's hotshoe , and the flash worked fine , switching back to the ettl mode . for a piece of equipment from canon , it 's hard to imagine it giving so many problems . it 's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories . as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord , i am forced to get another one and hope for the best .
1078,at 23 years of age , i can truly say that i have been a lifetime fan of sesame street . watching the 3-dvd set of sesame street - old school , vol . 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening . because i was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired , i expected most of the content to be new to me ( i was barely a year old when mr. hooper 's death was explained to the world ) , but that was not the case . many of the short films and interstitials were familiar ( and not just because i used to watch sesame unpaved on noggin ) to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s , and i think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning . sesame street truly revolutionized children 's programming , not just because it was educational , but because it was ( and remains ) entertaining , not pandering . i 'll admit , seeing gordon with an afro , orange oscar and the first few tries at big bird 's head still freak me out a bit ( as they did when i saw them on noggin several years back ) , but the show itself is just as good as i ever remembered , something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment ( like transformers or he-man or jem ) . the set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons , and 54 ( the liner notes are incorrect , they should have asked count for help ) bonus clips . the set also includes the 25 minute pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired , explaining sesame street 's message and motive . although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today 's pre-school children , i believe they would probably enjoy " classic " street even more than the current lineup of shows . the fact that today 's pre-schoolers may be more advanced than the sesame street of yore can really be attributed to sesame street itself , and that 's pretty cool . still , i personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults , because so many of us associate our childhood with sesame street . a booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and i found it informative . according to muppet central , a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues ( one with stevie wonder , one with rogers & hammerstein ) , but because i never saw the originals , i found nothing amiss . what astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years , more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced . no wonder they ca n't release full seasons ! although the full-length episodes are great , my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season . seeing kermit sing " bein ' green " in its original form , the " bread , milk and butter " cartoon and the " in in the sky with diamonds " parody is a real treat . the picture quality is great - - especially considering the program 's age ( and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video , although film was used for most of the interstitials ) - - i doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now . the sound quality is good too - - mono of course - - but clear and crisp . overall , i highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved sesame street . for those who were born after these episodes aired ( like me ) , looking back at the beginning is really special . it is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level
1079,installed great - looked good . day 3 it started blocking me from websites ' as their security certificate had been revoked ' - amazon even ? after a week of back and forth ' support ' they could n't fix it and left me with a partially working pc to drown . the pc support is partially automated as they did n't read my responses and their advice went in circles . plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare . it might work on xp but do n't get it if you have vista .
1080,i bought it 15 days back and it broke when i am chopping onion. . but its great to cut soft vegetables and even carrot is also good. . but i couldnt cut onions as mentioned. . probably we have to buy the onions from them hahhahaha.. . i dont suggest buying it for onions. . coz i bought only for onions so that i could save my tears
1081,i have been using nsw 2006 for a year and it 's never failed me . i 've always used symantec products and have always been satisfied .
1082,what a pile of junk . three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture . if you move at all during that three seconds , the picture is a blurred mess . even if you do n't move , the pictures turn out blurry and dark . and if you use the flash , you get a lovely white picture of nothing . i ca n't believe they sell this thing .
1083,i 'm a horn performance major , and i bought this box set because i needed recordings of all of beethoven 's symphonies but at a low cost . now first off , yes , they sound great . however , i 've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony : karajan changes beethoven 's orchestration ! allow me to explain : the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns - - instruments bound to the overtone series . on the " natural " or " hand " horn , pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment ( like a bugle ) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell . this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches , however , the " stopped " notes have an entirely different tone color ; most composers favored " open " pitches , especially for symphonic works . in the exposition , the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns . however , in the recap , the same call must be in the tonic ( c ) , as dictated by sonata form . the horn part is written for e-flat horns , which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major , the relative major . the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment - - they are all " open " notes . however , in the recapitulation , the c call would include two " closed " notes if it were played by the e-flat horn . the horns could change crooks and become c horns , in which case the call would again be all open partials , but beethoven does not do this ; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition , leaving them no time to change , or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement . for whatever reason , beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again , which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound , beethoven moved the call to the bassoons . in karajan 's recording , the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation . granted , if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns , he might have written both calls in the horn section . there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case , however . it strikes me as very arrogant to " correct " beethoven 's instrumentation , and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master 's writing is a more prudent performance choice .
1084,this is , i believe , the best fleetwood mac album ever record by the band . it begins with a nice quick paced tune , " second hand news " and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there . the album itself does not have a bad tune on it . in fact , of all the ' regular ' albums from fleetwood mac ( excluding greatest hits compilations ) , this album has more hits on it than any other . hits like ' dreams , ' ' never going back , ' ' do n't stop , ' ' go your own way , ' ' the chain ' and ' you make loving fun . " all of these get enormous radio play . moreover , ' dreams ' was a number one hit , and the album itself held the number one slot for months on end , and has sold over 18 million copies in the u.s. and over 30 million worldwide , putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time . in fact , an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the cd describe how the album had such an impact on america 's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell ' rumor ' there would inevitably be two ' u's ' in the spelling . now that is a very strong impact on culture . every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album . one of my all time favorite songs from fleetwood mac is on this album , " never going back " which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of rock 's premier guitarists , lindsey buckingham , and , in my opinion , the best christine mcvie song ever written , " songbird . " now , with this release , you can also get , on a second cd , the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album . this makes for great listening , to hear how the songs developed and were recorded . moreover , early demos are included along with two ' jam sessions . " now , more than ever , this is a must have cd for any lover of rock music ( or music in general for that matter ) . if you are a fleetwood mac fan , then chances are you own this album , but if you are just getting introduced to the band , then you must buy this cd . i highly recommend it
1085,got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well ! more than 3000 great pictures have been taken . the camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance . a word of caution - ensure that the camera does n't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it . the spring-operated shutter is very sensitive . would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera
1086,i really liked this cam bag..it serves its purpose very well and is really cute too !
1087,i have nothing bad to say . it gets hot enough . it was cheap . it seems well made . the cover is washable . it 's just what i was looking for
1088,this is the only album i own of joe strummer minus the clash . i ca n't say it 's very good . i hate having to compare it with it with his work with the clash but it 's inevitable . his lyrics are n't as great , edgy or provocative . there is n't any fantastic music either . i am not really sure what to say since i have n't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad , i truly tried my hardest to like it . but i feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake . believe me : i absolutely love everything about the clash , the lyrics , joe 's voice , the music , the attitude and how cool they were , this is not joe at his best , it 's cool though cause now he 's gone : go buy some bob marley albums instead , joe would not have minded
1089,there are just too many errors , of interpretation , omission and commission , in this book to justify purchasing it.in this review we will concentrate on rima 's ( r ) handling of the work of j m keynes.on p.84 , r 's claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is & quot ; surprisingly suggestive&quot ; of j m keynes 's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.on p.133 , r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand , a la keynes.what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and / or intuition that ricardo 's deductive , analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking ( or assuming away ) the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo.what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo.in chapter 20 of r 's book , she attempts to deal with keynes 's theory of effective demand and keynes 's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20 , titled & quot ; the employment function&quot ; .r should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book , replacing her chapter 20 with keynes 's chapter 20.r 's figure 20.1 , discussed on pages451-454 , directly contradicts keynes 's analysis
1090,this arrived the other day , i pre ordered it . two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion . its about time this was available on cd and here it is . sounds great ! go get it for the collection
1091,this is the best diet product ever ! i tried them all and " skinny water ? " is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever . the product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much . i drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away . i lost 15 lbs . in 20 days . great taste , it works great , and it 's so inexpensive . great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight . the owners should hire me to do commercials for them
1092,del the funky homosapien has been my favorite mc for years , and this album does n't dissapoint . the dvd is raw , and packs in lots of live footage , interviews , and is well produced . if you are a fan of del , you know you have to pick this up .
1093,as i watch the videos of my kids on my 50 " plasma , 32 " lcd and mac , trying to convince myself that i like the quality , my wife walks by and says , " fuzzy . " i know most guys out there will know what i 'm talking about - she just killed the deal . regardless of the specs , the wives do n't lie - the picture quality just does n't cut it . it 's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old sony dvr . the product design is cool , the price is good , the sd card recording idea is perfect , but the hd promise does n't come close to paying off . if you 're looking for sharp , crystal clear images - you 're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle .
1094,when it comes to buying camcorders , i personally like the one with the build in memory . but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind . unlike other sony camcorders , first of all , it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot . its a good use of your money . you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there . easy to use , touch screen , takes still photos , has a good speaker so it 's easier to record video and voice , fits into your palm so to speak , and if you use rewritable mini dvds , you would n't have to worry about go out of memory . so when it comes to sony camcorders , i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly .
1095,a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago , i listened to a few minutes of it and was like " what is this crap ? " and i shelved it for a couple months . i then picked it back up and gave it another listen . to my surprise it was really catchy to me . the music ( and lyrics ) are simple , but thats what i like about them . theyre simple ! this is a great college-rock cd . i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub , and i suggest you do the same . notable tracks are sidewinder , what you do to me , and is this music ?
1096,good : motor drive speed . grip feel . takes nikon lenses . reacts fast to pressing the shutter release . bad : skin tone renditions a color other than skin . white balance does n't balance well . noise at anything above iso 200 , looks like 3200. cf card door tough to open . screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot . battery cover is not part of the battery . button placement not as intuitive as on the d100. 4.1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements . dumped mine a month after i got it
1097,after 6 months of unexplained intense fatigue and malaise , numerous doctor visits without results , i obtained source of life vitamins upon the recommendation of a friend whose physician had recommended it for them . with the very first dose , i went from dragging around to walking around- -while most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen . at my very next doctor 's appointment , i told of my experience with source of life and i continue to report it to anyone and everyone that mentions being excessively tired . members of my family and several friends now regularly use this outstanding product , and have reported similar results . not only did i feel much better with higher energy levels , i also notice fingernail and hair growth as well . i use the liquid version and it is actually very tasty . i highly recommend this product . i 've used it for 3 years and have obtained consistent good results .
1098,i love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it . the product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at . the s2 is is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags . this bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries , chargers and extra media cards . there is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot . the correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens . given that limitation , this is a great bag . the bag is very well made and holds my canon powershot s2 is very securely . i lay the camera on it 's back and that means that even if i accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly . the material is great and the waist belt is very practical . the strap is well padded and after a day of use i believe it is one of the most comfortable straps i have used . buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it .
1099,this is my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports . after a few months of ok pictures ( the macro setting is not very good though ) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it . i would manually open up the lens cover each time . then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that . but now the camera is almost completely dead . it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps . i 'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this . i will not buy another canon camera . this camera was made too cheaply . i wish things were not made to break right away
1100,as a tape measure , it does what it says it does . you press a button and the tape tightens around your body part . you wo n't have to worry about , " did i hold the tape tigher last time ? " as the tension is always the same for consistent measurements every time . the tape starts measurement at 2 " since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures around 2 inches . i think this tape is accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you at the same tension level
1101,when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery . they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes . now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime , a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got the camera , charged the battery until the light went green ( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it ) and started taking pictures ( oh i also got a 2g cf ) worked great....so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots . keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong , still have 200 shots left for the trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button . so all in all , i think the battery life is great , now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point , the original will work fine . as for the quality of photos.....i love them
1102,does not cut hair as closely as their other model er 43
1103,i agree with the other negative review below - uninspired , simply forgettable radio trash . cliched lyrics ? check . muddy , simple riffs ? check . boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks ? check . thank god i got this in a box of cd 's from a dj buddy of mine for free awhile back . if i actually paid for this crap i 'd have to kill myself . judging from all the " positive " reviews however , it seems some people at lava records or possibly the band themselves ( if they 're still around . i hope not . ) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music .
1104,this is the best investment ever ! they start you out with everything you need from the liners to the paraffin . it was so easy to set up & start enjoying . i 've used it on average twice a week and my feet & hands are so wonderfully moist- -even in this winter weather . my heels are no longer cracked & my cuticles are so healthy- -not snagging at all . thank you for this perfect product & so much cheaper than going to the salon ! it 's so relaxing ( i use lavender ) as i do this just before bed
1105,the story of nasa 's sucessfull failure ! ! ! this movie is base on jim lovell 's book lost moon , the title coming from the fact that every other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second . lovell is the only man to circe it both times he went there ! what makes this film so realistic is that dave scott ( 7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon ) was technicial advisor on the film . i 've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released , and watching the film i 'd say to myself that this is about the time that xxx happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did ! look quick at the very end of the movie for the real jim lovell , he 's the navy captian with gray hair shaking t . hanks hand ! see the imax version last . several scenes have been edited out
1106,myths are important , but they should not be labeled history . 1. george washington was not a great guerilla leader ; he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines- -just like the redcoats . washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops . 2. ronald reagan did not begin the nuclear " disarming " of the soviet union . eisenhower and kennedy tried , but ( lbj ? ) nixon and carter were able to bring the abm treaty , the salt treaties and he start treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals . reagan did have success with theater wrapons in europe , but the " big nukes " that could end civilization were already being cut back . this is an interesting book about reagan and peggy noonan , but some of the history cited is wrong
1107,i have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968. granted , that version is marvelous . i have bought both versions and love them both . ok , it is difficult not to compare when watching . but i ca n't help wondering : if this version would have been the first i or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version , if people would have been complaining about that version ? i can have different versions of vivaldi 's four seasons ca n't i ? actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all ( and i do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other ) . we would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version , would we ? i have gone to the opera numerous times and watched don giovanni three times . every time with different performers . remake ? absolutely not . i think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it , because is such a great play . so , logically this would not be a remake ! why ca n't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other ( splendid 1968 ) version when doing so ? that done , i must say i understand why alais is in love with king henry . patrick stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses very well . he is a very good match to close 's queen . i did not care for richard , i thought he was not commanding enough , bit whiny . i think john is a difficult part to play to say the least and i did n't care for him either , too much the idiot . geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good . king philippe : too much a boy , although he has moments when the interaction with king henry makes him interesting . alais:good enough . which of the versions do i prefer ? that is difficult . i have highly enjoyed both . i think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of hepburn and i prefer her to close . this version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic ( alais and henry ) approach . i definitely prefer stewart to o'toole , who seemed too young for the role . i liked the way stewart made us see henry 's self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming ( that is , until the end , when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart ) . o'toole had a very serious approach all the time . on the other hand : anthony hopkins and timothy dalton were both splendid . i think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast . which of the versions i watch , depends on the mood i am in . i think they are both good in their own way .
1108,as any visual footage on ike & tina turner is pretty scarce , i guess we may be thankful for this great dvd . their 1971-show being integrally covered by dutch television , it reveals ike & tina supported by a pretty good band and , last but not least , by the marvellous ikettes . all this at a time their performance must have been at its very peak .
1109,this could possibly be the cheesiest movie i have ever seen ( and i have seen a lot of movies ! ) do not waste your money on this low-budget , low-acting-ability , low-camera-experience movie . i enjoy a good " gay movie " every now and then and this was not it . sorry to disappoint
1110,the title says it all . one can do better w / appleyard 's book
1111,this will be a present for my nephew george 's 37th birthday . he loved curious george as a child , and still does . it 's wonderful how someone carries a love for a childhood toy , book , etc. throughout their life . such an individual eternally has a special spot in their heart kudos to amazon for providing the book for $5.00 under market price .
1112,we have not received this item yet . please let me know the current status
1113,i ordered this item about a month ago...i got the package in about 2 weeks and was so excited to open it i was like a 10 year old who just got their first bike ! ...i opened the package to only find a the charger for the camera...yes...only the charger...no camera to be found in the package ! ! ! ! ! ...i was so pissed i called amazon and asked them where the hell is my camera...and this is what they said " oh im sorry...we probably forgot to put it into the package " ...what kind of @#$%@#$@#$% is that...so i asked the guy to ship me a camera...and to my luck their were no more in stock...so i told the guy to forget it and for him to send me a return slip so that i can get my full $220 dollars back because of your horrible / terrible / ridiculous service . it is now feb and still no money back...i keep calling them and they say the returned package is still in transit....ive never heard of a package taking over a month to get to its destination...but i could be wrong right ? i wouldnt be surprised if i never see my 200 dollars again...if i wanted to waste 200 dollars like that i could have flushed them down the toilet....what a rip off ! ! ! ! ! ...it was an amazon vendor as well...@#$%@#%$@#q^@#$^@#$%#$$%^@...never again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1114,we have a goldendoodle with a lot of hair and this clipper works wonderfully . it breezes right through the thickest hair ! i highly recommend

1117,as for many of these kind of unknown groups , the music in the album is useless . in the meaning that this music has no use . it is not relaxing . it is not for contemplation . it is not spiritual . it is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of " ambient " . but ambient music is music . this is crap . well differently from two a.d. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold , because people is n't stupid . two a.d. is light years away from this crap . do n't waste your money . listen the the samples by yourself to grab what i mean . sergi
1118,this is tha best master p album this and the movie this came out when i was and the 6 grade to lisen to this it 's emosional to me it reminds me of back n da day friends i knew all that my favrite song is mama raised me it gots bone , snoop , e-40 all no limit all them it 's a great album you can lisen to it most the way though it 's a great album gansta classic you gotta get this
1119,think twice before purchase : 1. most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected " all-time top 100 tv themes " , along with the best themes from other networks . 2. this disc has cds-100 copy protection , so you probably ca n't upload to windows media and definitely not to itunes . i could not upload from my internal cd drive , only from an external multi-format cd / dvd burner . it still only uploaded to windows media , not itunes . to get into itunes , i had to add the wma files and then convert them to mp3. this probably caused some quality loss as i 'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format ! a time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on " controlling " everything . hello record execs : if nobody can add your discs to their libraries , guess what happens ? they do n't play your music ! ! ! you might think you 're protecting your valuable investment , but you 're shooting yourself in the foot instead . here 's how it goes : 1. nobody can upload your music . 2. nobody plays your music . 3. nobody hears your music . 4. nobody recommends your music . 5. nobody buys your music . remember , this only loaded from a particular kind of drive , so it may or may not work on yours . as bela lugosi would say : bevare
1120,the first novel written by stephenson , and it 's a satire on college dorm life . pointless , rambling , and bizarre . it 's a good thing he 's improved his writing over the years , as this one stunk
1121,i got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base . the charger part of the trimmer is just too big . even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments . he would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for
1122,the best part about my ijoy 130 is the price i paid . day after xmas linens and things had only the floor model left . got 20% off of that plus signed up for the credit card to get another 10% off . 30% off made the chair $500 instead of $700. i am in it as i write this ! ! ! very nice and relaxing . sometimes the " percussion " setting is a little too hard in some spots but otherwise it 's great . i would agree that i wish it went a little further up the neck . i just sit a little lower in the chair for it . not sure if it 's worth $700 just because that 's alot of money but i 've got no problem with $500. i think my wife and i will get alot of use out of it
1123,i am not a " computer person " but found this to be easy , easy , easy
1124,the product does what it says it cuts your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container
1125,unfortunately , this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days . even though it may have been remotely funny ( sometimes the author comes close to being bearable ) , the book never actually tries to be . humour is supposed to be smart . however , this book gives us the worst case of dumb
1126,this album is absolutely fantastic ! paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together . paul sounds very loose and like he 's having a lot of fun - not as serious as some live shows i 've heard . the songs focus mostly on his solo records , with some jam and style council mixed in ( all on disc two ) . wisely , only five of the twenty three tracks are from " as is now " and they 're the uptempo ones - it 's not a hard sell by yep roc to make you buy that album if you do n't already have it . the extended jams for " porcelain gods / broken stones , " " in the crowd " and " foot of the mountain " ( one of my favorite solo tracks ) all are focused and do n't wander so they keep your attention . the crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the jam and style council classics get into the mix ( although the sing-along to the album closing " town called malice " is pretty lame ) . i have n't listened to the somewhat difficult to find " live wood " concert disc for a while to give a good comparison . however , since " catch-flame " covers all his solo discs instead of only " paul weller " and " wild wood , " this is a more balanced collection . highly recommended ! personal highlights : blink and you 'll miss it up in suze 's room porcelain gods / i walk on gilded splinters in the crowd foot of the mountain that 's entertainment broken stones long hot summer shout to the to
1127,i made the mistake of ordering this product and microsoft office 2007 which i did n't realize that it was also offered in office 2007 which i did n't need 2 of them so i gave the other one to my sister who just loves to keep all her records in the
1128,i expected so much more from this movie , i guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors ( jolie & washington ) and also had the always on point queen latifah as well . i watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie , but i walked away bitter with shattered expectations . first off i will say that latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason i smiled on occasion during this movie experience . washington and jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable ( especially washington who really strained in this role ) that i was constantly asking myself " do i really like these two ? " and i had to remind myself of movies like ' gia ' and ' training day ' to answer with a resounding " yes ! " the film follows a rookie cop ( jolie ) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop lincoln ( washington ) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called ' the bone collector' . the ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer , while not who you 'd pinpoint , is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever . it 's like " oh so he / she did it...interesting " ...and i 'm bored . i 'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling
1129,this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory i have ever used- -including dos , win 3.1 , windows 95 and windows 98. aside from being incompatible with older hardware , xp home edition crashes frequently-particularly if you like to work with several windows open at once . most important , the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers . preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware . true enough , the built-in firewall ought to work . but in my case , hackers got in anyway . i had to hire an expensive data recovery guru-another story in itself . even reinstalling the program did not solve the problem . my computer was completely compromised . i was eventually forced to junk the machine . after my dreadful experience with xp home edition , i have sworn off windows forever . mac and linux are both far superior
1130,with a compelling story , great music , great lyrics , and two outstanding female leads , aida certainly delievers . right from the start with the goregous " every story is a love story " , the listener is captured by the wonderful spirit of the show . the seamless tranisition between ballads and showtunes is flawless . the three stars of the show each being something different to this recording . while adam pascal is always great , he 's the weak point on this recording . i much more prefer him in rent , and i do n't think his voice suits this show very well . sherie renee scott is teriffic as amneris , and her powerful voice fills this recording with the powerful opener and " i know the truth " . the star , however , is heather headley as aida . her tony-winning performance will be forever immortalized on this recording with big , raw , emotional , and powerful voice . she 's is perfect in every way
1131,while " scary movie 4 " does work in getting out a couple of laughs , it certainly does not live up to the past three . many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly , are getting pretty old . although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as the grudge , saw , and war of the worlds , it misses the funny mark just by a bit . personally , i felt they could have done a lot more in terms of parodying these films , particularily with the grudge . the writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier . and really , was it necessary to spoof films such as brokeback mountain and millionaire dollar baby , both of which are not horror films ? i believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience , and is vastly different from what scary movies 1 & 2 offered ( which i found to be extremely hilarious ) . if you 're looking for over the top funny , look towards the other scary movies
1132,this camera was a great investment . the photos turn out wonderfully . better than a regular film camera and i have kept an eye out on simular cameras...price wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price . the only problem i have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but i think all digital cameras have that problem . this is a great camera
1133,after norah 's first two cds and the little willie 's cd i was greatly looking forward to this release . to say the least i am disappointed . i was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep . where is the range of work ? all of the songs on this cd sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me . i 'm giving it 2 stars just because of norah 's angelic voice , otherwise i 'd have to give this one a 1 star rating
1134,i 've used paperport for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options . however , version 11 is buggier than earlier versions : every time i launch a microsoft office product , the paperport installer starts up . there is no reference to this in the paperport help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the paperport site . another bug imprints a " trial copy " legend on your pdf files . this one is explained in the knowledgebase , but requires you to tinker with the registry to correct it . that 's a bit ridiculous . why are they distributing code with a known bug ? nuance expects you to pay $9.95 for e-mail technical support - even if it 's a bug in their own product . the product is a modest performer at best , but nuance 's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here . i 've requested an rma for a refund . jerr
1135,we have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great ! when it changes color all i do is plug it in for about 10-12 hours and then hang it back up again ! we are very satisfied
1136,i 'm a fan of the line , i love the chocolate , but this vanilla was too fake tasting and too strong tasting . vanilla should be subtle , this was more like taking a shot of extract .
1137,a love story between a couple that does not want to bein love . very good book , like all that i 've read from this author .
1138,i 've been using norton antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with norton internet security 2003. now that it 's time to renewal norton antivirus , i thought i switch to trend micro internet secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines . i like norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the taskmanager considering i was running a p3 500 laptop with 196mb on winxp pro , resources are valuable . also newer norton antivirus version were a hit and miss . after also reading reviews at amazon , i took the plunge with trend micro . my review of this product can be best summarize along with it 's relations to norton antivirus 2002 ( updated ) . pros of trend micro 2005 : 1. fastest virus scan i 've seen . i have not find any virus in my system yet whereas norton would fail in about .01% of the time ( i.e. one stalling virus every year ) . 2. check incoming and outgoing mail like norton 3. scan selected files as i chose just like norton 4. alert and block virus threats 5. monitor nearby wifi connection 6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. ( it 's been 2 months since i 've mailed it and not received it yet ) . 7. uses about 10mb of system background resources versus norton 's 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005 : 1. very annoying auto-virus update every day that i log on the internet . i only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes . i 'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself . norton is not as annoying . 2. on a wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 of the gibson research shields up test . ports were open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which was n't a big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it 's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection . 3. anti-spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop-up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4. still waiting for rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 for it 's fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me . on it 's own merit , trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i would n't mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram .
1139,this book is so awesome ! ! ! it has so much great info in it . it is a book that is so easy to read before you know it your done . it makes you really think about your relationship prior affair and after affair . what went wrong and were it went wrong at . it offers so many was to open up communication and how to talk to one another without fighting . there isnt enough things to say how awesome this book is . must have for anyone in a bad situation . it has a questionnaire at the end that both partners can do and an agreement for both partners to read and sign . it helps lift your spirit and makes you think that this isnt the end of the world and that you can make it through . i have a new found hope for my marriage and a new attitude towards everything . i am looking at the bigger picture and the brighter side of things . i am alive and i still have my family and my husband . we go to thearpy and with all the great info in this book just put what we have learned into action and hopefully great results will be the outcome . get this book you wont regret it ! ! !
1140,this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington before this product gives me nothing but trouble
1141,dj shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today . threading the thin line between commercial and underground , and finding his niche somewhere in between ( as unkle says , the middle ground between light and shadow ) dj shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth . i was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release , and actually purchased it before i bought endtroducing , which is by far dj shadow 's best album , and one of the best albums ever made . by sampling elements from just about anywhere shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value , and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music . i am actually glad i bought this album before endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is ; a work of art , and a continual growing of shadow 's talents . had i bought endtroducing before this and writtwn a review i 'm sure i would have garnered it with a 4 star review , but that is simply not the case here . while endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album , josh davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album , and given us an album that i 'm sure years from now i will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time . best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home ( possibly with a little mary in tow , if you know what i mean ) , the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows , and the beats are flawless , especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis . see the thing is that shadow bases his music upon how he feels , and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve . radiohead for example has a way of doing this , and it is not surprising then that one of dj shadows favorite artists is radiohead , they both fuse these elements into their music , and achieve monumental status in my opinion . the package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation , and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package . if you enjoy this album then i highly recommend any of shadows works : endtroducing , preemptive strike , the private press , and in tune and on time , which is a live set recorded in support of this album . unkle is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop , rock and techno , with guest appearences by mike d of the beastie boys , thom yorke from radiohead , and others from throughout the music industry . if you 've never heard of dj shadow before , then i must say that you are missing out , if you are at all interested in underground music , do yourself a favor and pick up any of shadow 's albums or collaborations , i guarantee you will extremely impressed , as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time . peace out
1142,i had a wahl clipper pair before . it was a good pair of clippers . the pair i owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad . that was the pair i wanted again . the pair i have now does not perform like the previous pair . so i 'm stuck with the pair ihav
1143,who in the world called this ' 'hard rock' ' ? ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ? this is a bunch of self-pitying , mainstream jibberish..nothing interesting at all . i shall dub this as ' 'alternative whine'' .
1144,...for indesign to not have one basic features . everyone i know still does french folds , but in order to see double page spreads in indesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program , then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page , layout by layout . this is mortally stupid . at this point adobe should have figured how a tool like i.d. is actually used in conjunction with a printer , not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen . the oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool . why is n't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output ? why do i have to slave over a document like this ? adobe , stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results . also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this ? mine shows me a heavily pixelated , entirely xparent bw image when it supposed to be a cropped color image . what do you want me to do with that
1145,it 's been 30 years since i 've seen this film on cable . i decided to re-visit this obscure film and see if i missed anything in the initial viewing . as it turned out , i did n't miss anything . it 's pretty much the same , routine sam peckinpah film , filled with lots of blood , guts , bullets and slow-motion action . it 's also a long , tedious film that is not one of his best , but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra-violence in their movies
1146,this collection brings together five of the older british war stories and is excellent value for anyone who enjoys such movies
1147,i recently a box of two 12 ounce bottles of this neutrogna produst at costco for approximately $9.00. $22.00 for the same quantity is too expensive for me to want to shop for these products at amazon
1148,i bought this filter for my 28-135 is canon lens and so far it has worked out great . unlike some of the other tiffen filters i bought , this one fits just right on the lens . all sides are even and it sits flush against the lens . i have n't noticed any artifacts from pictures i 've taken yet , but i have n't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens . the night shots i 've take so far , i 've been quite pleased with , however
1149,the songs just did not get me dancing . i have to say i was disappointed . but i love kids favorite songs vol 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
1150,good product but , it 's kind of too complicated and difficult to set up and fine tune to work the way we required
1151,my kids ( 6 and 8 ) are learning so much from fritz and chesster 2 ! ! in fact , my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game ( from fritz and chesster 1 ) . today i decided to play with them ( since they do n't like to play against each other - they 're still working on that " good sportsmanship " thing ) , and i let them team up against me . i was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead , predict moves , and protect their pieces . however , i was the one who learned ! ! they surprised me again and again by reciting strategies ( move your bishops and knights out , save your queen for the real battle , do n't move your pawns willy nilly , break your oponnent 's wall , etc.. . ) they had learned from this game . they also knew the relative value of the pieces , but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes . for example , they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall , which they later exploited to checkmate my king . this was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them . anyway , i defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics , dialogue , and strategies . i am sure that at some point , my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer . but for now i could n't be happier with the chesster and fritz games ! my kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just " computer chess " , but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me . i think i 'm going to go demand a rematch : )
1152,i 've seen several pretty funny comedies this year , but none of them could touch what i watched saturday night . this dvd had it all , slapstick , funny costumes , hilarious sight gags , geeky dancing and more . there were times i was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt . i just could n't stop laughing and in fact spent most of the show with tears rolling down my cheeks . it was so funny , that i felt at a couple of points i was going to lose control of my bowels . yes , it 's that funny . i highly recommend this one , as it 's the closest thing i 've seen to the classic monty python days of english humor . i do n't know when i saw a movie that was non-stop hilarity , without a single moment of serious content . over two hours of complete madcap behaviour and a near fatal dose of cheese . the name of the dvd ? castles & dreams , by an english comedy troupe called " blackmore 's night " . these guys are like a combination of monty python , benny hill and marty feldman . my sides are still aching.... . those crazy f&^king brits... .
1153,if you have children that are five years & younger , this would be a good album to put in your child 's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player . but if your children are six and up . your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs . this album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it . this ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in rwanda , sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap . parents , if you buy this album , after your children turn 6 years old . pack this cd and other ki8dz bop cd 's and send them to africa . this is pop music for impoverished folks
1154,he 'd always had problems with frequent canker sores . after he tried this ( on a recommendation from his dentist ) , his canker sores went from 2-3 / week , to 2-3 / year !
1155,the satin finish and the design are very attractive . i had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great . you might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going . the directions , which i lost , said something about priming . installation was easy . it includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips . i went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure . i figured if i ever have to remove it , i could just pull it off and use goof off to remove the adhesive . if you fill one of the chambers with body soap , i recommend neutrogena rainbath refreshing shower and bath gel , original formula and a natural sponge . i bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at wal-mart and it 's a little rough
1156,i was expecting much more from this flash , i already started looking for the better one . if i knew this was a closeout item i 'd never buy it . it died on me with no indication , sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it . now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries.. . save money and buy 5xx series flash. .
1157,is it really necessary to take minute-long solos in every song ? really ? if you like your solos long-winded and lacking in destination , and your lyrics trite ( get a job ? ? ? ) , check these guys out . if you actually plan on listening to the music you buy , skip it
1158,i installed this software after getting it free after rebates , and i must say i am not the least bit impressed . it claims to speed up your system , but instead only slows it down . seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer , but it 's relatively new and has a gig of memory . as another reviewer mentioned , my internet stopped working correctly ( although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet ! ) and my system restore just would n't work . it deleted a lot of entries i needed to run my system correctly . the anti-spyware was an absolute joke & the updates were large files almost every day . 8 mb a day practically . on a lighter note , fix-it utilities found a virus other programs were unable to find . i use zone alarm security suite and then use ccleaner to take care of the rest . i think they 're the best combination . no program beats zone alarm's . fast , secure , and wo n't bug down your computer . i had to reinstall my operating system thanks to fix-it utilities
1159,there was only one good song on the disk dont waste your mone
1160,although this sports new remastering , unless you have either the golden hits cd available here at amazon and your local cd shop , the now out of print golden celebration boxed set or the 2 volume " patti page collection " series ( volume 2 is also out of print ) , this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on golden hits except for let me go lover instead of with my eyes wide open i 'm dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order . fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with let me go lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff , either buy golden hits , the boxed set and the 2 volume patti page collection series , and btw , vol . 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at amazon
1161,small town america.. . only this is n't the pleasant and white-picketed small town america of film noir fame , it 's the gray and colorless small town america of neo-noir , and there 's the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it . a bum who 's being approached by that famous " man in a black trenchcoat " ... hard eight ( aka sydney , but i 've yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title ) is a debut pretty much as promising as blood simple to the brothers coen . paul thomas anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best , with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want ( or expect ) them to do , but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout . anderson also uses neo-noir color to great effect , allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir . that said , anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies , and despite the long takes and steady-cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies , he focuses most of his time on the characters ' faces , and just lets them be . if he had n't already done the amazing and always stunning later work of magnolia , boogie nights , and punch drunk love , i 'd say that this is a " promising debut that makes me impatient for the next anderson picture to come out , " but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt , i must say , " see this to see anderson at his roots , " and " man i ca n't wait for his next feature ! " - -polarisdi
1162,i have been using computers since dos 5.0 and this is by far the most user friendly , comprehensive , and powerful operating system i have used so far . aside from linux , if you are interested in an easy to use , dynamic os go with xp professional . it has lots of features that are always coming in handy . unless you wanna go crazy and are an it power user ( in which case linux ) , go with this os . its great
1163,this is a good cartoon for competition with rocket robin hood hope they come to quick agreable turms ... msp.. . didnt see the black wolf or fox ? ?
1164,for a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment , this book was a pleasure to read . the concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation . however , i specifically enjoyed how steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports . from establishing values to finalizing the contract , this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process . also , at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading . winning with integrity is n't easy in general , let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents . leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book
1165,i recently moved into the prosumer level of digital . the canon d30 has proven to be an awesome camera . there maybe better ( d60 ) , but if you are serious about digital , the d30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price . there is a slight lag between shots , but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains , the time between shots is hardly a distraction
1166,this was one of the first hiphop albums i ever purchased and i still listen to it today i think that krs 's style was best suited to primos production . once he lost primo ( with the exception of a few albums ) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly . krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack mcs that deserved it . this was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his bdp days as well as few musical / lyrical tricks up his sleeve this album along with any other bdp release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into hiphop this was the era that i belive hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now i wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper .
1167,i do n't recommend this ashtray to anyone . i was never able to use it since there were no instructions with it and i could not figure out how to put batteries in . other people tried besides me . there was no way to contact the company as their website does n't seem to exist anymore . at least i could n't contact them after numerous attempts
1168,we all have very pale skin in my family , and these are great little " i forgot to put on sunscreen " helpers ! i keep one in the car , one in my purse , etc. , so we are never without one . excellent product , and easy to use
1169,i own both the ultimate editon and the extreme dvd . i want to say that you can play the theatrical version on your t.v with the two-disc extreme special edition , on your menu on disc it should say play special edition , hit right four times and " the future is not set " should be highlighted , push enter and you should see " play theatrical version on your menu . i am a little dissipointed that when i bought the extreme dvd at best buy it did not have a metal case . either way i love t2 , it 's a classic that never gets old
1170,although this dictionary 's contents are extensive , the screen functions are relics from the dos era . they are laborious and clumsy . to find a word for difinition , it has to be spelled perfectly , there 's no list of proximations to the word entered . changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor does n't show up in the entry slot . if someone knows of a better software , i 'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks ! ! maria mcgowan
1171,first of all floetic was a brilliant album and after i heard superstar on the radio i thought flo'ology was going to be a classic too . i was wrong . this album lacks originality , its inferior to be precise . the first time i popped this cd into the system , i found myself being friends with the skip forward button . the length of the records is despicable this cd is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is superstar and i think common is amazing
1172,war exposed some violence simmering within one gulf war veteran . christian bale is electrifying as jim , a tough-minded ex-ranger whose brutal nature did n't subside after his return home to la . they say war changes a man . this might be evident here , but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of jim . along with his buddy mike ( freddy rodriguez ) , the two tear through the town , bingeing on drugs and alcohol . their is no deep plot here , just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs . but it is a great character study , watching jim self-destruct . bale is great in this type of role , like he was in american psycho or the machinist . i liked this movie much more than training day , which this director previously wrote the screenplay for
1173,advil liquigels are excellent for headaches . i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks ( as advertised ) . i ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped . it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store ( like i had to eventually do when i ran out )
1174,yes it is a very fine lens . is and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this i decided to sell it in favour of my ef 24-70 2.8l after 2 weeks of usage . f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier . bokeh is also worse than the other one . the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies . 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size . plus the macro option is weaker on this one . if you do n't care about the weight go with the ef 24-70 2.8l imho .
1175,this disc dates from monk 's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for columbia . so it 's valuable from that point of view . it 's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio blue note recordings that immediately preceded it . the best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended blue monk , which many consider the definitive version , and a lovely unaccompanied just a gigolo , which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as alone in san francisco . sweet and lovely is in a similarly reflective vein . much of the rest of the album has a forceful , driving quality , with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for monk . a particular highlight is monk tearing through these foolish things
1176,i bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually i bought it twice , since i did n't have much choice where i was shopping . both times it died . the first iron lasted about 6 months , and the second lasted 2 weeks ! just dies , no warning . my girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a conair ! i am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research
1177,the lenes work on the factory lens only with no feature to add additional lens . it works as advertized , i would have like to add the wide / tell lens to the filter for better out door videoing
1178,hard to figure why sean stewart is n't one of the most beloved writers in america , given the virtuoso performance he 's demonstrated here and the remarkably sympathetic character he 's created in will kennedy . a combination horror / fantasy work which is as reminiscent of a confederacy of dunces as it is ghosts , by hynd , this novel is filled with so much warmth and life that it 's hard to remember that this actually is a story about a man who understands that the past , too , can be a ghost , and perhaps the worst kind . perfect circle is everything every other supposed 5-star horror novel featured on amazon is supposed to be : well-written , compelling , with rich , empathetic characters and a driving force and tension all its own . it 's a wonderful introduction to mr. stewart 's work
1179,same as the other review . the thermometer will not turn on . i wo n't change the battery because i do n't think i should have to pay for it if i bought a brand new product . i will return it and buy a better thermometer
1180,i ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover , instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once ... well , they do have a different cover , but the listing on amazon did n't say that the pads shut-off after one hour . i am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself , and do n't need / want any auto shutoff . these two heating pads are going right back . i can get the regular heating pads that do n't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price
1181,do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity . if you do , you are in for a fall . both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining . this one has no such pretensions . it is merely boring . the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town 's folk out of their claims . they do this through intimidation and violence . when a couple of friends get hold of a claim , they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys . to do this , they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction . they yell , they fight , they wrestle , they shoot and then they do it some more . its not very exciting cinema . this production is made worse by the dvd . i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair . the dvd , however , is of such low quality that who could really tell ? the edges are clipped off , the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it . it was not worth the effort . spaghetti westerns can be fun . this one , however , needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn .
1182,tiger is simply the most advanced personal operational system on earth ! i am an advanced used . i have used all sorts of operational systems in the last decades : irix ( unix from silicon graphics ) , sunos ( unix from sun ) , linux , and also the bad written windows . everytime i used windoze in the last 20 years , i had to deal with crashes , hanging , lost of data and hours of configurations , tuning , adjusts , cleaning , etc. even today , everytime i shutdown windoze , it hangs , due to some program crashing . it 's a true joke ! ! ! on february 2005 i decided to buy a mac and give it a try . i bought a mac mini and started using it . what i have to say is that i am using it for more than an year without an issue , without a crash . system is solid as rock . some bad written programs eventually crash , but never the system . and i am the kind of guy who works with several heavy programs with heavy documents opened at the same time . mac never crashed . i am about to suggest apple a way to make it crash , so we can rest a little bit , instead of working all the time . so much trouble i had in the past with windoze that even today , while i am using the mac , i feel like it will crash at any time . fortunately it never crashed . beyond those functions advertised by apple , you will see that macos is a superb gold mine for those who want to explore under the hood . filled with thousands of powerfull unix commands and programs , you will be able to perform miracles . microsoft is copying everything it can from tiger and advertising it as revolutionary features of up comming windows ( hasta la ) vista . i cannot see a single revolutionary function on vista , as everything already exists on tiger . the most amazing is some sites on the web comparing vista ( a vaporware not yet launched ) with tiger ( an actual product ) . the only thing gates forgot is that one month after vista is released , apple will launch leopard that will take the crown from tiger . what i can say you is that for the first time on years i have joy of using a personal computer .
1183,not a great deal of new insight here . i did learn a bit more than i knew , however , about meade 's failure to pursue at gettysburg . mr. boritt is the editor and author of one essay ; other essays are by four historians : stephen w . sears , mark e . neely , jr. , michael fellman , and john y . simon . ( alan j . jacob
1184,this is a very good camera for the price range . i have always had good luck with sony products , unlike some of the reviewers here . the resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what i would expect from a camera in this price range... . it 's pretty decent . for what most people use dv cams for , this is camera does n't suck at all . i like how tiny it is . it does n't go much past the palm of my hand when i 'm holding it . also it was very easy to figure out just by exploring the menu on the touch pad . color graphics & icons on the menus add a nice touch . a beginner could start filming very soon after opening the box , i think . the camera feels sturdy in my hand , i mean i do n't feel like the viewer window is going to break off when it 's open or that i could easily break the buttons with normal use . as others have mentioned , you have to buy a 4 to 6 firewire if you have a mac because the ilink cable that comes with it is a s-video input for tvs . also the battery that comes with it is the 30 minute battery but i would have bought an extra one anyway because you never want to wait around while your only battery is charging . the software cd is a do-it-yourself install , at least for mac . it might not be for pc . i 'm used to being guided through the installation process.. . ( since at least the early 90 's ! ) but i had to drag the folder to my hard drive my darn self . a minor thing but i would have expected more from a major company like sony . but the reason i give it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the firewire goes into the base , not the camera so you cannot have the camera on a tripod while it 's connected to your machine . i realize this will not be a big problem for very many people but since i do stop-motion animation and use frame grabbing software , i need to have it connected to firewire and on a tripod in while i 'm working . i almost returned the camera when i discovered this but instead i hot glued velcro to the bottom of the base and to my tripod adaptor so i could have the firewire plugged in and attached to the tripod....kinda ghetto . i figure it was worth it though since i got such a good camera for the price ( i paid $299 on sale for it . ) if you 're looking for a decent but cheap camera i would recommend either this one or the hc42 if you want to shoot in widescreen .
1185,i have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends , a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week . a neighbour suggested the mr clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she did n't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub . i am disappointed with it . the one thing i did like was the pole . i was able to scrub the tub , the tile on the walls without needing to overreach . that said , i really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub , and still could n't get it all until i used my regular scrub brush . i think i was expecting this to be a way that i could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so . the other thing that bothered me was that you have to rinse off the stuff after you scrub ; from watching the commercial i feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you 're done . at least it was n't that spendy so i do n't feel too bad about the wasted money
1186,this book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator . provides good case histories as well as " ghost stories " that can be used as examples on investigations
1187,hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink . i do n't know about the rest of the cd , but listening to the reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal . i 'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn . egad
1188,unfortunately i was extremely unhappy after listening to the album . unlike many other altan fans , i view maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career . the problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place . and the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like & quot ; well i guess we have to put a few instrumentals on&quot ; kind of effort . i 'm sorry , but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs . she is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and inspired arrangements made them for me the top irish folk group . alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels , jigs , etc. i miss frankie kennedy 's flute too . goodbye altan , your best day 's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days
1189,alliterative analogies , assertively assembled , appear aplenty , appropriately , apt and artful , absorbing attention ad infinitum . this could be a fitting summary of abish 's stunningly & quot ; now&quot ; novel , written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between kabbala and alliteration . chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter a , chapter 2 with a and b and so on until chapter 27 , when z first , then chapter by chapter all other letters , are progressively subtracted . in spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature , the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary , they may have been culled from today 's headlines : polysexually inclined thugs hide in africa after a crime spree , with the author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them . chasing after the thugs from country to country , we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite , war and genocide , corrupted burocrats and soldiers , rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air , where sparsely assembled people wollow in african indolence . all is narrated with poetic detachment , in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social , political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality : it is just that the words were limited by my artifice , reader , the author seems to smile . no harm intended . perhaps : the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974 , to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy . great art , when unhindered , relates to the whole of time , in all tenses . while amusing , abish has managed a ponderous read , which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices , inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events . attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme . and wonder : was it accidental ? & quot ; in order to be perfect , all i lack is a defect&quot ; goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet
1190,...for indesign to not have one basic features . everyone i know still does french folds , but in order to see double page spreads in indesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program , then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page , layout by layout . this is mortally stupid . at this point adobe should have figured how a tool like i.d. is actually used in conjunction with a printer , not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen . the oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool . why is n't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output ? why do i have to slave over a document like this ? adobe , stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results . also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this ? mine shows me a heavily pixelated , entirely xparent bw image when it supposed to be a cropped color image . what do you want me to do with that
1191," the other boleyn girl " and " the queen 's fool " are two of the best books i 've ever read- -and i 've read a lot of books , especially about this period , which especially fascinates me . they were gripping to the end , and my involvement with the characters was complete- -true masterpieces . so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out , i buy it , hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed . " the virgin 's lover " fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give it up . one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly- -that is always an easy guess , however it depends on the writer . anthony trollope , for instance , was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed . that may or may not be the case with gregory . i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source , and times when it 's harder , more mechanical . the more challenging situations are those when i 'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject . so to me , neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse . they feel forced , constructed . i 'm going back to trollope
1192,ok , maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much . the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera . both my 30d and rebel xt . if i am lucky enough it will fall off , get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory
1193,this would be a great item except it is n't clear that it only works on handles that are pointing to the right . our doors have the handles going to the left leaving this item useless for us
1194,this has been a good purchase for us . we are in northern italy for about 7 weeks , and needed to navigate a number of cities : for several business meetings and just to find our way around . it has been an invaluable tool . we have still used physical maps to a certain extent , but in finding the shortest routes , and other points of interest , this has helped us never to be lost ( so far !
1195,this is a wonderful and very useful program , not only for school age kids but also for adults . it is full of useful information . it comes very handy when you want to learn about anything . look for any topic , you will find it there
1196,this album has morse code on it , what more can you say.. . ...well some of that morse code actually sounds like that ua6 you just worked on 40 metres , complete with t6 buzz and slow drift . and the music is pretty good too .
1197,this product is not even directionally accurate . it said that my body fat percentage was 10% higher than actual . then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25% body fat . perhaps we had a lemon , but i am taking this back because it is very inaccurate . in fact , this is the first review i have ever written because i want to warn people about this product . please do not waste your money
1198,i purchased this case for my canon a530 camera . i find that it does a great job of being light , durable , and compact . it keeps the camera clean and scratch free . however i wish the case had a better carrying capacity . i would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips . i use different ones for different pictures or video . batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy . the case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn . that can be a bit akward . otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well .
1199,some will mistake me for a evidence hater , but i 'm really not . i just want the man to put some effort into what he does . i 'm tired of taking just any ol ' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the " fans " do n't expect very much - - or simply do n't know what good is anymore . sure , you can relate to what evidence is saying , but you can put on a dope instrumental cd , sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head , have a discussion about any topic , and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album . i quickly get tired of the " slow flow " - - see : talking - - and i feel like anyone can do it . i do n't shell out money for things i can do myself . really , the only difference between him and 50 cent is content . when i hear someone say " slow flow " my mind translates that into " reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on " because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came . and lot of these beats , though very dope , are as slow as his flow is . couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like joe scudda ( i 'm sorry , i tried to like him , but dude is simply terrible ) , big pooh ( same goes for him ) , and madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener . the only dope guest shots come from phonte , planet asia , and slug . yeah , i know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names , but i 'm going to keep it honest - - fu** real . when ev actually puts his back into it , he creates some dope material . " down with new york city " is nice piece of work that has ev gettin ' busy over an air tight jake one track . " chase the clouds away " is another track where ev does his thing over a pounding alc production . the standout to me had to be " line of scrimmage " which features ev and atmosphere frontman , slug , getting nice over another dope alc creation . with the likes of alchemist , sid roams , jake one , dj khalil , babu , and evidence himself providing dope beats , i 'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the lp . simply put , i do n't recommend playing this cd while operating heavy machinery . i respect ev and his whole crew ( hell , i love rakaa ) , but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat . i can only call it the way i see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not . bring on the unhelpful votes if you want , but i can only recommend this to the die hard fans - - who should eat this one up . everyone else should download this and test it out first . standout tracks : letyourselfgo feat . alchemist & phonte , a moment in time feat . planet asia , line of scrimmage feat . slug ( my favorite ) , and down in new york cit
1200,the foam is tooooo. . soft . it 's does not give me any back suport that i need it .
1201,warning ! i resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot . it destroyed my system and i had to format my whole drive . read all the reviews from this program carefully . i read them but did not believe them
1202,first bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician . it seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary . here 's what chaps my hide the most . bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch . it burns me too no end when a person calls himself a & quot ; jazz&quot ; guitarist , but does n't really have any chops . i know bill has been called anti-technique , but what does that really mean ? would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well , but really is n't very good at what he / she does ? this guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time i turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face . i 've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years . when i have guys that actually debate me that bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say pat martino , or that bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like pat martino , i have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that frisell could n't imagine . is bill frisell a jazz musician , no ! maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he 'd come up with something . for me i 'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......johnny smith , peter leitch , jim hall , pat martino , kenny burrell , billy bauer , tal farlow , lenny breau , jimmy bruno , jimmy raney , wes montgomery and so on
1203,received as a christmas present , dead by february 24. well , actually , that 's two months . now all it does is flash an error message , and nothing i do gets it out of that mode . i liked it before it died on me
1204,this is the 2nd year that i have used the neutrogena ultra sheer dry-touch sunblock , spf 45. i have normal to oily , sensitive , acne-prone skin . i am fair and can burn easily . i think this product is well worth the money , it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel . it does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out . i apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours . the time will vary depending on your sun tolerance , though . it is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile
1205,i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past-shoulder-length hair . it works great ! i gotta admit , it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the " extra large " size towel ( which is n't really all that large .
1206,bone thugs is always keepin it real . this album gots good production and of course them good lyrics . i love the beats on this album . the songs i got in my top 5 are straight bangers no doubt . this double album is a classic by bone thugs . you should cop this album . all tracks are 4-5 minutes long , each emcee spittin there verses , good stuff . definately check out this album now ! ! ! my top 5 songs 1.handle the vibe 2.look into my eyes 3.body rott 4.it 's all mo ' thug 5.ai n't nothin change
1207,thought i 'd died and gone to heaven ; this lens was everything i wanted and more . three weeks after receiving it we went to the grand canyon , and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus - now it does a focus dance , clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus . it 's not my d70 , which still works wth other lenses . this one 's going back to it 's maker ! if they fix it , i 'll revise this review
1208,the power cord that accompanies this charger is bulkier than the charger itself . you would n't get that from the picture . too bad , other manufacturers have learned to incorpaorate the plugging mechanism directly into the charger .
1209,i cannot stop listening to the song i saved the world today . the cd is worth the price for this song alone . the whole cd is great though ... classic eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work . annie lennox gets all the attention ... and she deserves every bit , but dave stewart certainly deserves as much . they make a great team and this cd should have been given much more attention in the usa . i hope they do n't take so long to do another one
1210,i once had a cheap shaver i got at sears that i learned was made for sears by remington . i liked that shaver , so when i found the r-950 at sears on sale for $40 , i decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver . big mistake . after 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck ( especially with drier winter skin ) , not to mention the occasional cut lip i get with the r-950 while trying to shave around the mouth , i am going back to my old shaver . how can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave.. . but it does .
1211,purchased as a christmas gift for a friend who uses this product , he was excited to receive this . i was excited that i was able to purchase it at a considerable savings over department store prices . this same product in a smaller size retails for $45- $55 locally and i was able to purchase him a larger bottle for less than $30. this particular item by davidoff is not always easy to find and i was glad to not only find it here but to find it at such a reasonable price
1212,edmund o'brien is a cpa who decides to get away to san francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats ( and also to get away from his secretary who 's nagging him to marry her ) . there he 's poisoned and told he has only a few days to live ; he tries to find out who poisoned him and why . the trail takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing . following this trail is a bit confusing for o'brien and the audience . but the picture is tightly directed and well acted . a highly regarded film-noir entry , and rightly so . worth a watch
1213,very disappointing . the shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate . it is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it ca n't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use . predictably , when you turn on the shower , the head drops groundward , spewing water in a horizontal spray . installs easily , but save your money
1214,is n't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of al jolson ? the problem with so many new-traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience . hippies and white liberals love it , but where does that leave those that are living it ? far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas , south of the border , and east la 's lysa flores , north of the border
1215,this may work well , but the cuff size is not as it is in the description . it says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches . not even close . my arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far . sure , you can get the cuff to go around your arm , but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly , and there was just no way to even come close
1216,i bought this for my four girls . they all love it , ad are learning lots . but the quality of the graphics , characters , and even theme ( or story ) seem to be low budget . we have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch ( and play ) . the overall quality in our other games is much higher . it is a lot like comparing disney cartoons to speed racer . but...my oldest , who is 11 , still enjoys this program and has not complained about anything i write about here
1217,great to own such a john candy / dan akroid classic . not recommended for children . quite a lot of profanity
1218,for real , you gotta give this man props . i repect him and his music , but it 's not my style . he still managed to make this a good album , so it 's all good . much repect .
1219,as soon as i got this item , i tried it out right away . i will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that 's a minor point . the real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do - - take down mosquitos and flys . sure enough , i killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes . i also took down a housefly without any sweat . this is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where i 'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects . no more an issue
1220,i agree with the other reviews . it was a huge disappointment that it did n't heat the water . it is only supposed to maintain the temperature , but after using it for about 20 minutes , it did n't even do that . the manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth . back to the store indeed
1221,i like using a tripod with my long zoom lens , and this device has really added to my hobby . the remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard . i personally do n't like cables , i do n't like dealing with them . this is just right for my purposes . the remote is also better for taking pics of people . it is much better than a timer in my opinion since i can move people in and out easier and more efficiently , taking pictures more quickly . this gives me so much more control than using a timer .
1222,i have a hard time believing that the author has ever seen an episode of tng . i had to force myself to finish this book it was so bad . by far the worst star trek book i have ever read . if you want a good one read ' federation ' and stay as far away from this one as you can
1223,this was a great history movie , and in excelent condition at arrival , thank yo
1224,... i really was n't expecting a writer i would like almost as much as howard and mckenna ... what a great find ! if you like uber-alpha , warrior , edgy good-guy hero ( ex navy seal ) and a likable , feisty heroine , you have got to try this author . read this in one sitting
1225,what can i say other than this is simply hands down the best operating system on the planet ! we were spoiled by how flawless it performed , and sold our pc soon afterward .
1226,not that great . a far better read is " sun , sin and suburbia : an essential history of modern las vegas " by geoff schumacher .
1227,its super cheap , does not work at all , will struggle with the thinnest of hairs . stay away ! !
1228,i purchased this software for my brother to use for his daily reports . he works for a police department and the old documents transferred over quickly and easily
1229,this book provides excellent information about what rheumatoid arthritis is , how to distinguish it from osteoarthritis , etc. however , i do n't want to live with ra , i want to recover from it . as such , this book offers no help in this regard . it tells me about drugs that i can take and splints that i can wear to help me from becoming completely disabled , but offers me no hope of recovery . in contrast , the book " conquering arthritis " by barbara allan , is the well-researched account of someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover from the disease , to get their life back . and succeeded ! i 'm well on the road to recovery myself by applying the principles in her book . now that 's a book well worth spending your money on
1230,this book was great . it read well and never was too slow . it was fair to both sides of the war and the leaders who fought the battles and planned the campaign . it was complete in that it discussed the men , tactics , weapons , and terrain in the southern campaign . not only was this book a great souce for the southern war but it also gave good insight into the revolutionary war in general . if you 're interested in this topic and want to increase you 're knowledge of the southern war , get this book . it 's informative as well as pleasing to read
1231,this truly is a masterpiece of pop music . there is not a wasted moment . the songs all blend together majestically one after the other . you really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect . i agree with the reviewer that stated that ' do n't look back ' is one of the best songs i have ever heard . i told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays . i do n't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart . i had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive .
1232,my two year old only child adores this dvd so much that she 's " adopted " max as an imaginary younger brother . there 's no flash and no dash , no special effects and no tired slapstick - but there is charm , gentleness , intelligence , humor , and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life . my daughter views max and ruby as such a treat that i used it as a potty training reward - and she 's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it . ages 18 months through five . five stars , and then some
1233,if you 're looking to hear robert johnson 's songs , you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible . as this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years , i 'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs , and talk about his life.. . that 's all we have now . and of course the covers do not outdo him ; that would be impossible . but there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of robert johnson and the world he lived in . the discussion with a former classmate is touching , and the covers of his songs by those who knew him ( robert lockwood jr. , honeyboy edwards ) and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as guy davis , roy rogers and especially alvin youngblood heart blew me away . gov't mule and sonny landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work . the major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n ' roll hall of fame gathering , and also bob weir 's performance , which is just plain bad . all in all , it is a good film , and it 's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music , as we will never be able to see the real thing
1234,i recently purchased this for use with my 550ex . if you use alot of flash for event photography , you will want this in your kit . it is expensive , but i think it is worth every penny . it will keep you from changing aas in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant . you can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure . you can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt . mounting on my 20d was just not comfortable . it gets in the way of the hand-grip
1235,i bought this from qvc after i had to send back a braun silk epil . the epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness . waxing just hurts too much and is really messy . this sounded ideal i just wanted to have a smoother look on my cheeks , and upper lip . it trims down your facial hair however , the next day you will notice stubble . you have to really look close to see it , but you can really feel it . you might as well shave . i have not used the brow attachment , i saw the demo on qvc but am afraid i will shave my brows off . would love to know what others think of this item
1236,granted , i saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party , but i think i had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was . it 's so.. . bad . it has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved , and the script was just awful . gosh , it 's hard to believe i actually sat through it . it was just so.. . exactly what it was , i guess . a stupid sex comedy that 's absolutely terrified to be anything else . the thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material . i think my real downfall here was the fact that i 'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys . the scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it 's almost ridiculous . now , i 'm not one to get offended easily , but this just took it a bit too far . just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed , which is n't really something i look for in a movie . it just seems to me that if ' gay ' had been replaced with ' black ' , this would have been deemed racist and probably would n't ever have been released . not that i 'm condoning censorship , but when your tone becomes so.. . mocking , i guess . oh well , i guess all i 'm trying to say is i will definitely not be repeat viewing this film , and i do n't recommend you view it at all if you 're a woman , or gay , or you care about others
1237,i did n't think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release - but they have . while " faded seaside glamour " is more immediately catchy and refined , " you see colours " comes at you in a much more intense manner . the songs are more mature , the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies . the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer , but there 's honestly not a bad track on this release . the delays put it all together - great songwriting , strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody . it 's a shame these guys do n't get more recognition here in the states . buy it
1238,this fugifilm padded soft case is strong , durable and very attractive . it was more than i expected . it is very professional looking
1239,i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these.. . ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except " dog eat dog " which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an ' 80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the ' 60s and ' 70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , " dog eat dog " ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul
1240,dream is a great album where keller coloboarates with many of his favorite musicians including bob wier , bella fleck , victor wooten and string cheese incident . all the songs are unique and great to sing too while driving or anytime !
1241,did you ever know someone whose life was just " perfect " ? ? someone who went to college , got married at age 23 , found a great job with valuable stock options.. . someone who settled down in a house in a nice city at age 25 or 26 , started a family a year or two later , and who now seems to " have it all " ? ? well , after world war ii , this happened to just about everyone in the silent generation , and it happen to most in the boomer generation , and it 's happening to just about no one in generation x . this books speaks to members of generation x and describes the suffering and coping mechanisms for these people . this book , now 15 years , is about a generation that was sold down the river by its elders - generation x . the book describes 3 young people , andy , dag , and claire , who visit palm springs and tell stories of their lives and of their friends who are suffering in life . the author douglas coupland is actually telling stories from vancouver british columbia , one of the first cities in north america to be sold out to foreign economic colonizers from hong kong ( who escaped to vancouver to avoid the 1997 mainland takeover . ) in this city , the worst 1100 square foot fixer-upper house costs a third of a million dollars , or 10 years of take-home pay for a mid-career household . economic success is impossible in the physical confines of the city - the system is rigged against everyone except rich immigrants and the existing upper class of blue-collar boomers who purchased homes in the 1970 's and 1980's . many aspects of the book ( such as " reverse sabbatical " , " mcjobs " , etc. ) reflect the severe economic conditions faced by high-achieving intellectuals who go nowhere economically in that city . in my grandparents generation , all you had to do was to go to college . in my parent 's generation , you needed to go to college and become a successful professional . in my own generation , you need to co-found a startup company and be among the 10% of founders who can sell off the company or have an ipo . do you notice something here ? yes , it 's getting more and more difficult to be marginally successful in america . because gen x'ers find that traditional paths to success - hard work , taking chances , saving and investing - do n't work any more , they resolve to live like their parents by either living with their parents or by borrowing money endlessly and hoping for a miracle . fiscal irresponsibility is at an all-time high , and has squandered everyone 's future ! in this environment of perpetual economic slavery , coupland counsels generation x'ers to break free of the traditional career models that have been rigged by their elders for failure . coupland counsels us all to re-examine what is success in our life and how to achieve it . this book is a call to enlist in a class warfare between gen-x'ers and their elders ! in many ways , this book is similar to " the razor 's edge " by w . somerset maughen or " the monk and the riddle : the art of creating a life while making a living " , in other words , redefine your notion of success in the world , while waiting for our evil society to implode in upon itself , which must surely happen in the near future ..
1242,recently got my sleepmate and it is very effective . somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom , and i do n't have any trouble sleeping . i use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night , and have the hardest time getting back to sleep . i hardly ever wake up at all now . great product , and i 'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night 's sleep
1243,to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad . the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky ( rodney eastman ) was in the movie . ( for about 5 mins ) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars
1244,i did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion . while it was unique , it was too hard to get into . i also really hated the story , it was also too confusing to follow , to strange to enjoy , and to boring to care . i totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read . the only reason that i read this was because it was for my book club . the reivews , by the way , in the club were 50 / 50. some loved it , the rest of us hated it . there was no in-between . i would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to english majors , i 'm not sure who else would like it
1245,so , yeah , it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups , and once it 's mounted , it stays put pretty well . unfortunately , it has so far never actually been " fogless . " get a good shower going , and the mirror fogs up in record time . splash some water on it , and you can see yourself for half a minute , but overall , this is a disappointment .
1246,we keep this in our kitchen and sanitize dropped baby toys and pacifiers as needed . it takes a 30 minute cycle , and you just put things in and walk away . it has n't damaged anything vs. sanitizing in the washing machine - and i do n't have to worry about any chemical residue from spray sanitizers . we 've even started to use it on more things around the house like toothbrushes , etc. to periodically clean them . i think it 's great
1247,adobe standard 8.0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions . if you do research and want a better interface , design and functions then you need this new version of adobe . it is an incredible tool for gathering , sorting , copying and formatting information . it also is faster than older versions . see details ( above ) on amazon . recommended for all information-knowledge workers
1248,this cd is a must have ! you cannot afford to not buy it . the information is comprehensive and easy to follow . the format is perfectly set up.. . you can review a section many times if needed . every family and individual in america should view this cd to know what to do when a terrorist attack occurs.. . not if , but when , it occurs . for instance , before watching this cd i had no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach to remove radioactive materials from your skin , but these items will make chemical burns worse . i feel much better having this knowledge from the cd , and this is just one example of the useful and critical information i learned . the preparation checklists on the cd are awesome for planning ahead . knowledge will be powerful in protecting yourself and your family in the event of another attack
1249,a great recording . " the greatest bass solo ever recorded " ( as put by another reviewer ) is certainly a stretch , but the album is still magnificent . heavy sounds is a title that accurately describes the music . buy and enjoy .
1250,outstanding ! i new a remastered version of ran was a must have , but i did not expect to enjoy madadayo as much as i did . while i agree the packaging does not protect the disks well , i got lucky and had no damage . i wonder how they will handle this issue if they truly only made 5 , 000
1251,5 classic films by one of the best african american directors of all time for $20.00 ! if you think this is n't a great deal than obviously there is a problem ! mo betta blues is one of the most well put together pieces and if you enjoy the films i suggest listening to the actual soundtracks

1253," animal farm " is a personal favorite of mine . and i dont understand why this song does't get more recognition - in my opinion , the most underrated song ever written ( yes i know , its a bold statement ) . theres something about davies ' voice in " animal farm " that makes this song unforgettable - particularly in this part : ' while i lay my head upon my pillow little girl , come play beneath my window though she 's far from home she is free from harm and she need not fear she is by my side and the sky is wide so let the sun shine bright ' the build up to davies screaming " she is by my side " is really breathtaking . the title track and " starstruck " are just as excellent . this album is a real treat and should be in everybody 's collection
1254,i 'd give this no stars but it wo n't let me . why would anyone buy this ? i was in compusa today as they are closing down on long island & thought about buying this . i put it down & said i will researh this more at home . as i suspected , you can go to [...] & do the same thing that this software does . the software does n't allow you to print stamps at home so what 's the point ? the only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps , so it 's like buying a [...] coupon , that 's a one time use . i do n't get it
1255,malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail . i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs / matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books . he almost makes the process seem easy , and maybe it is , if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant . however , much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a " plateau'ed " or " downward spiraling " church that has been around for 100 years . the principles are easy and make sense if you have 100% support of the congregation . that 's pretty hard to do in most of the churches i 've been in that need strategic planning the most . that 's no fault of malphurs ; the book itself is a great book
1256,i 've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight . this past christmas though i got the conair tourmaline ceramic straightener as a gift and decided to try it out . not only did it not work for anything , it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass . also , it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener . needless to say , i 'll be taking this back for an exchange . i suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair
1257,i really enjoyed my nano chi iron while it lasted ( rip 7 / 06-11 / 06 ) , it handles well , it 's a great straightener , and it 's a pretty color . however , i dropped it approximately two feet , onto a carpeted floor , and it stopped working . i purchased the chi about four months ago and think that a $120 iron should be a bit more resiliant . i 'll still purchase chi products , but would n't recommend investing in the nano technology just yet...there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out , and it 's not worth having to pay an extra $35 to have it repaired
1258,in march 2006 , there are only three or four books that boast haskell in their titles . they are all excellent books . but the world can benefit from more haskell books . in fact , we are in need of such books , especially cs1 texts . this book is a pleasure to read . i suspect that even math haters will not find it hostile . anyone learning haskell will find the book and its companion web site a valuable resouce . on the web site , you will find the source code from the book , such as powerseries.hs . you can quickly play and experiment with it ; read and learn from it . i wish more books are as pleasant and affordable ( $25 )
1259,this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times . it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties . eli wallach is good but confusing- -who and what is he after ? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it isn't . what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better- -less comedy and more plot and of course - -action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare- -- -i would n't
1260,i bought this in august 2005 , when the original battery that came with my nikon coolpix 880 ( late 2000 ) started running down fast . on the page i ordered from , it appeared to be a genuine nikon battery , however , when i received it , it was not . it was made in taiwan , and does not have the nikon brand name anywhere on the battery ( or packaging , as i remember ) . this battery has never held a charge well . it 's about as bad as the original battery is now , and i 've only had it a few months . maybe i just got a lemon- -but i 'd recommend you buy a genuine nikon , if you can find one
1261,camera obscura is similar , in an inferior manner , to nico , of the velvet underground & nico . the band makes pleasantly dull " chamber pop " in the vein of belle & sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years . even their name is ripped off of nico 's last studio album , camera obscura . but , as i said before , camera obscura is much worse than nico . if you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like , pick up " chelsea girl , " nico 's first solo album
1262,hysteria . ** i see great polarities in the reviews of this record . i fall in the camp that sees this as a overproduced microtargeted superficial pop record designed for radio and mtv . i consider that shrewd writing & marketing . brilliance is a term i 'll reserve for led zeppelin . i tend to like my rock harder , with two arms and less cheesy . sadly , this record does n't fit the bill . for that , pete willis era def leppard suits me much better . i do n't need to give you a song breakdown by breakdown . the important factor here is what you enjoy . if you enjoy superficial 1980s mtv pop or mindblowing heavy rock - that distinction will determine your opinion here . this album is definetly the former . i 'll beg to differ with the amazon reviewer - it *does* sound dated . its a record thats signifigant for its hype . when listened for its depth . it is symbolic of the later part of the decade which it was released . prepare to be transported back to the spandex era on plopping this disc in
1263,if you are young , under 30 , this is a good guide to help you figure out your path through the minefields of trying to understand the other sex . if you are older , this is a good refresher course on things you may have already learned ( or things that you missed ) in the school of everyday life . for both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others .
1264,this is a perfect office suite for those who do n't need all the new stuff that is available in office 2007. outlook appears to be working great without some of the hang-ups in earlier additions . probably more stuff in here than most people need , but it is easy to use and has some great enhancements
1265,we ordered this program only two weeks before moving to bogota , columbia for a two year tour . however , the spanish rosetta stone taught was much higher level than the survival spanish we needed when we arrived . overall we are learning the language and it is a great program . wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing
1266,as one who is not an accountant , i found quickbooks premier non-profit edition 2006 to be very easy to learn . read the books that come with the software before you dive in
1267,i rented this ( sigh ) several years ago , liked it or julia roberts enough to buy it but did n't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today . i regretted buying a new copy after all , remembering it only as a few heartwarming ( i did n't want my heart warmed ) months in the lives of just plain folks in ct . ( incidentally , the 3 girls are not sisters , just 2 of them . ) i made fun of it , my friend made fun of it , i watched a few minutes then turned it off , then watched some more , finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it . it has charm . it is a soap opera , but i thought it was well acted and well done . it had humor , happiness , sadness , embarrassment ( like the barrels of fish in the rich kid 's car ) , love . it had so much plot that it practically had none at all . and i liked it . but now , 15 minutes later , i 'm beginning all over again to wonder why i bought it . i could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick . that man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all , no range , no depth , somehow he could carry a tune , but that 's about the size of it , speaking of size , the size of his ego ( which i assume is why he did n't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics ) would have made a mushroom cloud ! i recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing . for it 's kind , i thought it was perfectly done . i just like them a smidge more sophisticated . the vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious .
1268,when i purchased this camera i was really conflicted on wheather i should get a digital still camera or a digital video camera . so when i decided still and found out the canon powershot had a video feature , i was pleased but had very low expectations . boy was i suprised ! this camera has so many fun features for both still and video pics . and the quality is awesome for both ! there is a video email option so you do n't have to guess if your videos are going to fit into an email . but if you want you can create some really good quality video with a quick adjustment . and all of it transfers easily to my computer . plus with still pics there are lots of easy features to choose from so you can quickly set up for any kind of shooting sinario .
1269,i love this product , but i wish i could see all floors put together as completed home in 3d view .
1270,hey , that just goes without being said . all of their live albums suck because they suck . go creed ! i ca n't wait for scott stapp 's solo album ! awesome , baby
1271,i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist - up - and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat
1272,maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with chekov 's work and therefore have no preconceived notions , but i found this british made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution russia . the story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose , and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy , sentimental , or even tragic
1273,a very good , very quick military history overview - hits all the main points without belaboring any , gives the reader a good list of authors to look at after finishing howard
1274,i 'm very sorry , but the universal remote control was not what i expected.like , when i want to turn on my tv . the vcr came on and visa versa . but the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money.very pleased about the service , thanks.regards yoka van dijk .
1275,along with " from science to god " mr russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening . although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work , it has the same hopeful message and the same readability . in both books mr russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo , even when discussing very complicated subjects . that is n't a statement on his intelligence or research , but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels . neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings . in short everyone can sit around his table ( well , almost everyone ) . read'em twice .
1276,every thing he sings is perfect , i 've yet to find one song that does n't move me . this cd has some beauties . & quot ; daughter of mine&quot ; is priceless . & quot ; steal away&quot ; is very nice . & quot ; one small star&quot ; brings tears . this arrangement of & quot ; voyage&quot ; is probably the best i 've heard . his traditional songs ( & quot ; when you and i were young maggie&quot ; and & quot ; mary of argyle&quot ; ) are beautiful . i ca n't find anything on this cd i could n't listen to for hours . i truly love music and listen to it constantly . i find myself reaching for the mcdermott cd 's almost exclusively . i have them all , more please
1277,this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made . i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies . they are either worse than this one ( rare ) or better than this one . as an example : buffalo ' 66 is worse . if you watch both in the same day , you will surely die
1278,i just upgraded my webster software to this version for winxp . it 's ok and does the job it 's intended to perform . but i liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels . just a matter of display preference , so it 's not that important to every user .
1279,i am rating this program just one star because i found out after ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders . i did go to the nuance website before ordering . they did n't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard . anyway , if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing , you need the preferred version , not this one .
1280,as others have noted , this was a time of turmoil for the group . now trimmed back to a fourpiece ( they had just lost guitarist / singer bob weston and singer dave walker ) , they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with martin birch on . this cd also leans really heavily on material from bob welch ( this would be his last release with the band ) and it suffers deeply for that . most of the few highlights here are furnished by christine mcvie . the title cut is a nice lament about male prevarication . the understated " prove your love " is also a winner . of the welch contributions , the only real standouts are the mystical " bermuda triangle " and gentle closer " safe harbour " . there are plenty of miscues , filler , and outright bad material here . mcvie 's " come a little bit closer " is produced like it wants to be a hit , but it 's much too slight to stick in the memory . welch 's " she 's changing me " sounds like chicago colliding with the mac...the horns do n't work here . the handclap bridge in " silver heels " seems too poppy and out of place in the context of the rest of the tune , which is execrable anyway . the silver lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell turned into the band 's finest hour just one album later. .
1281,...and if you 're fortunate enough to find it , i recommend buying the version with the bonus dvd , which chronicles the making of yellow brick road . when i bought it , it cost the same as the 2 sacd set without the dvd , so it was still a great deal . my only complaint- -and it 's really minor- -is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single sacd . a second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package , plus any extra- -maybe even audio-only interviews- -still remaining in the vaults . no matter . the important thing , if you are able , is to make sure you have an sacd-compatible player ( like the pioneer dv-563a , or one of the really expensive players if you 've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your cds ) . even if you do n't , the stereo cd layer still sounds truly excellent
1282,this is among the most disappointing symantec products ! ! ! when one tries to log in to the infovault , the login box is often empty ! there is no way to submit the information . it is also impossible to get a straight answer from customer service . bring back the old product , please ! ! ! ! have been a norton customer for years....this one is just not great ! !
1283,i purchased this dryer for my wife . it took me a long time to find it since all hair dryers come with 1600 to 1850 watts power setting . my wife 's hair is thick and long , so she did n't want get anything below 2000 watts . this one is light , powerfull and handy . i strongly recommend it
1284,wow , this book should be given to every graduate entering the workforce along with their diploma . not just about cards , but also contains business etiquette , marketing tips and techniques , and ( un ) common sense . wish i had read it 20 years ago . required reading for pretty much anybody who has to go out into the world and deal with another person
1285,cheap trick 's second album is very disappointing to me after the good , but raw , " live in the studio " , 1977-76 recorded cheap trick . almost all of the material here is so watered down that it really comes off way better on the later many live disks they did . after a good start w / " hello there " , a concert favorite for many years , is the only thing here to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the budokan and other live recordings later . tom werman and rick niesen were on a show in 1991 that i had recorded on a tape once and werman , noce a friend of tom petersson 's said , quote : " my three albums with cheap trick got better and better.. . " , to which the ever sarcastic rick nielsen said , " selling , maybe . " not realizing that brother rick was slamming him , werman then continued , " exactly " ... oh boy . we now see why producing cheap trick albums through the years has become like playing russian roulette . it 's not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid , but somewhat oeverrated ' heaven tonight ' came out.. . ( and the guys even bought werman back for dream police . things turned out better when pete comita , then later jon brant joined the band . yep - the best was yet to come - in the ' 80 '
1286,you will probably read 50 / 50 from the reviews on this software . having used the older poser software.. . one thing i am a fan of is miki and terai yuki...japanese virtual beauties and if you are a fan of japanese styled video games and the character designs , the fact that e-frontier is now the company behind poser 6 , i 'm so stoked . granted , the software with bundles ( best to buy it bundled with other cool software ) , there is a free software out called daz3d . daz3d content creators make stuff for daz3d and poser and vice versa but no matter if you go with the free program or poser 6 , the result will be the same...expect to pay money for content . i highly recommend getting the book " pratical poser 6 " because it 's very , very informative unlike the manual . next thing...before you buy...mosey down to daz3d.com , contentparadise.com , renderosity.com and ask yourself , can you afford to buy the content . content costs anywhere from free to over $100+. and the good stuff costs money...maybe not a lot but it does add up . the next thing to know is that after you buy the content , due to how the hair or clothing conforms to the body ( or how it 's placed ) , they are not organized . to make matters worse is that the names that the creators have called their work are long that the window for the selections ( figure , pose , hair , prop , etc. ) can get cut off and so , it becomes a bit of a choir to go back and forth to certain folders . but i got used to it and the thing is ....all developers for the content are helpful . content paradise is a great place to buy your content as well as from the creators websites as well . there is a lot of trial and error and i wish there were more undos...because really , although there is an undo...you mess up...you ca n't just undo...you have to start over your from your save file ( and hopefully you saved ) . nevertheless , the stuff i was able to create in poser is wonderful . i will say that i have spent a lot not just on the poser and the bundle but the content . it adds up quickly ! ! ! so , consider the benefits for you . although i love the characters from daz3d and the ever popular foxhair , i 'm more a fan for poser but still expect to be buying content from dax3d for use of poser .
1287,for anyone on the fence about these , jump over to my side ; ) my ( then ) 2 year old had gotten a hold of my husband 's permanent black marker . we just bought a brand new refrigerator . i turned my back for a few moments , and when i looked back , she had scribbled *all over* my new fridge . i tried bleach , soap , scrubby sponges.. . nothing worked . my first new appliance was ruined ! on a whim i bought this . ( could n't hurt , right ? ) it got it off immediately ! ( i had to press a little bit to get it out of the grooves . ) i was so excited , i started running around my house trying to find things to scrub.. . i know that it removes shoe scuffs with ease , markers or crayons from walls , and a multitude of other " sins " your children may commit against your home .
1288,i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others , hoping to learn about america 's prison system . i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic . unfortunately , in the first twenty pages of the book , elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10 , 000 citizens . if you do the math , that equals 7% of our population . 7% of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york . according to this author , there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york . before you get too worried , let me reassure you that this is not the case . america imprisons 736 people per *100 , 000* citizens ( as of 5 / 06 ) , or .736% of the population . this is the highest rate in the entire world , so there 's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic . for comparison , stalin had .771% of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges . again , there 's really no need to exaggerate america 's rate of incarceration . what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page , but is repeated several times . apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our population , and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well , as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover . personally , i ca n't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out , on the first twenty pages no less . if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10 , how do we know the rest of the book is n't off by a power of 10 ? elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine . do n't buy this book
1289,for those who have watched the movie jaws ( ask yourself , who has n't ) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it . this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly , with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film . the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information , which gives the overall package a nice touch . the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent . a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music
1290,rarely is there a book that i can not put down , this was an exception . quite a suspensfull page turner . any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that . i would have given it 5 stars , but i do not like romance blended in with any suspense novel , that 's just my taste . by far , however , one of the best books i have read in a long time
1291,i love this pretenders album and chrissie always rocks but i love the songwriting skill of billy steinberg & tom kelley . they wrote " love colours " , " night in my veins " and the hit " stand by you " . her follow-up to this , " viva ! el amor ! " also contains three tracks written by them . i purchased this long after its release and was glad i did . steinberg kelley write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord changes . something not all big names can do on their own and chrissie wisely is aware of this .
1292,after some research online , i decided to purchase this dryer because it had all the qualities i was looking for in a lightweight , compact model . it worked great while it lasted , but unfortunately it died 6 months after purchasing it . one day it worked , and the next day it started smoking and sparking ! !
1293,why buy iolo system mechanic when you can get malware for free ? i installed pro 7 and it gave many , many problems . iolo did not respond to my emails so i uninstalled . their uninstaller did not work either
1294,i do n't have a review , i have a question . as a grandparent of a 10 year old blind girl . is it possible that someone could send me directions for this game ? i would like to get it printed in braille for her . thanks for your help..judi ree
1295,i know that this product works for some , but for me it did not . that is why i decided to return it . wahl makes great products , but this product was not for me . my skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it .
1296,perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of lincoln 's various works , such as the sacred place , the messianic legacy , and holy blood , holy grail , or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books . the dvd will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books . however , it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about the da vinci code . the narrator , mr. lincoln , takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the languedoc , home to the cathar heresy and the albigensian crusade , and points out some interesting details in his wandering . yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture , and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture . as well , he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals ( many inspired , it would seem , by lincoln 's books ) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions . i finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark- --i cannot imagine what else mr. lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour .
1297,this music is a rip off . all is borrowed to the 4 first albums of marc bolan playing under the name of tyranosaurus rex . something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy . a shame
1298,i am a fan of tanya huff and the series of books with henry and victoria . but this one is not it . while henry is there he is such a minor character . the main character is tony foster a homosexual street kid who tanya should have left on the street . i was totally bored and read the book through because i was hoping it would get better , then i was happy when it was over . the plot idea was great , but it was not developed well and left me wanting for something more . i was expecting henry to be a major player like he was with victoria , but no , he is relegated to tony 's homosexual vampire lover who helps tony out . disappointing . dull . i wo n't read the rest of this series , the tony foster series . hey , tanya , how about a series of henry fitzroy , i would read that
1299,so many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife 's little belly , and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever ! this book describes to a ' t ' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process , and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny . before i read this book , i was like " what the heck is wrong with my wife ? " after reading this book , i was more like " ohhh , i know why she just ripped my head off.. . she hates the smell of carrots ! " great book , fast and fun read , a must read for a new dad . i 've bought it for every father to be , and they in turn have done the same .
1300,as the reviews below indicate , " arthur " has a lot of fans - - when it was released in 1981 vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful " screwball comedy " ( although over time , times readers , perhaps more discerning than vincent , have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars ) and bravo listed it #10 on its list of best comedies ( see below ) . i first saw dudley moore in " foul play , " thought he was very funny . based upon that , i bought " 10 " and " arthur , " as it turned out a downward trajectory . what i dislike about " arthur " is moore playing a loud , obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes , and minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves arthur for himself , not for his $750 million fortune . even john gielgud , who was great in " the loved one " a much better comedy , ca n't resurrect this turkey . okay , folks . start casting your negative votes . in the meantime , here 's the bravo 100 best comedies list : 100. anchorman 99. the birdcage 98. school of rock 97. happy gilmore 96. four weddings and a funeral 95. harold & kumar go to white castle 94. waiting for guffman 93. the aristocrats 92. father of the bride 91. revenge of the nerds 90. clueless 89. slapshot 88. team america 87. the kentucky fried movie 86. zoolander 85. dirty rotten scoundrels 84. silver streak 83. sister act 82. tootsie 81. half baked 80. lost in america 79. three amigos 78. bananas 77. flirting with disaster 76. ghostbusters 75. dumb and dumber 74. trading places 73. city slickers 72. moonstruck 71. roxanne 70. the nutty professor ( eddie murphy ) 69. the blues brothers 68. broadcast news 67. kingpin 66. dazed and confused 65. office space 64. this is spinal tap 63. manhattan 62. the pink panther 61. election 60. when harry met sally 59. police academy series 58. private benjamin 57. swingers 56. young frankenstein 55. bull durham 54. ferris bueller 's day off 53. dr. strangelove 52. meet the parents 51. national lampoon 's vacation 50. the princess bride 49. american pie 48. american graffiti 47. 9 to 5 46. the incredibles 45. raising arizona 44. sixteen candles 43. what about bob ? 42. harold and maude 41. austin powers 40. monty python and the holy grail 39. mrs. doubtfire 38. best in show 37. dodgeball 36. good morning vietnam 35. beetlejuice 34. rushmore 33. clerks 32. groundhog day 31. the big lebowski 30. the 40 year old virgin 29. legally blonde 28. annie hall 27. a fish called wanda 26. wayne 's world 25. meet the fockers 24. bill & ted 's excellent adventure 23. big 22. beverly hills cop 21. shampoo 20. the jerk 19. wedding crashers 18. stripes 17. m*a*s*h 16. old school 15. fast times at ridgemont high 14. napoleon dynamite 13. naked gun series 12. the producers 11. pee-wee 's big adventure 10. arthur 9. ace ventura : pet detective 8. blazing saddles 7. the wedding singer 6. airplane 5. south park : bigger , longer , uncut 4. there 's something about mary 3. shrek 2. caddyshack 1. animal house my suggested additions : " the loved one , " " leap of faith , " " used cars , " " eulogy " and " drop dead , gorgeous .

1301,gosh , i would really like to review this adapter , but- - - amazon has put my order on indefinate hold , as thier supplier is unable to get any more . but wait ! what 's that blurb on the product page - " availability : ususally ships within 24 hours " and " want it delivered tomorrow ? order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes , and choose one-day shipping at checkout . see details . " so they ca n't deliver it , yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow ? do n't order from amazon
1302,yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile . but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole . the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it 's pretty bad . how possession ever became a hit i 've not idea . well , where i come from it did n't , but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits . the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album . neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck . besides , he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash . pity , listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man . rockin ' horse for example . an interesting additin to the aor landscape , and some of the music is lively . but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't get my vote . even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track ( we all know which one ) . but hey , if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse
1303,i did n't discover the delight that is the artemis fowl series until a week ago , when i read artemis fowl in one day . so , of course , i had to pick up a copy of the arctic incident right away , to see if it was as good as the first . it definitely is , and in my own humble opinion , i think i liked it even better than the first book . there are points throughout the book where artemis , now thirteen , shows a softer , more vulnerable side that i truly enjoyed . do n't get me wrong , he 's still an evil genius , but he 's an evil genius with heart , and you ca n't help but love him . now that angeline fowl is out of her depression , thanks to some fairy magic from captain holly short , she 's sent artemis back to saint bartelby 's school for young gentlemen in ireland . artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing the school 's counselor , dr. po , when he gets an urgent message from butler , his bodyguard / butler / majordomo- -it seems that artemis fowl the first is alive in russia , being held for ransom by the russian mafiya . young artemis , of course , immediately sets out to devise a scheme to rescue his father . it 's been almost two years since artemis senior was last heard from , and his son is most eager to bring him home . before he can work out a devious scheme , though , he 's visited by none other than captain short and her superior , commander root , and brought down to haven city and into police plaza . it seems the goblin triad , the b'wa kell , have a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling , and artemis the second is , quite justly i believe , suspected of being that human . the fairies soon realize , however , that this time artemis fowl is n't the bad guy in this problem . but now they 'd like artemis and butler 's help in figuring out who is behind the allaince between the goblins and the mud men- -and artemis is quite willing to help them out , in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing his father . what follows is an action-packed story of good versus evil below ground , with deceptions , backstabbing , and revenge taking center stage . as holly , root , butler , and artemis race to save haven city from being destroyed , some of the same characters from the first book make appearances- -foaly , mulch diggums , cudgeon , and captain trouble . there 's also a new foe in the arctic incident , opal koboi , to be dealt with . i highly recommend the artemis fowl series to anyone and everyone . highly enjoyable , thoroughly entertaining , and not soon forgotten .
1304,amazon.com made sure i received my items in time . above receiving the movie in excellent condition , the movie is entertaining and reminds you what real acting is .
1305,never recueved the product . waiting for refund for over 6 weeks
1306,very nice bag and well made . however , i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment ( cords and charger ) .
1307,if you are buying this because you love rob , be aware this is the rob wearing his goblin cock hat . if you are n't familiar with this incarnation...let 's just say it ai n't the rob of pinback or heavy vegetable fame . same guy , different sensitivity . i fell in love with rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there . on this outing , rob has met the enemy and it is himself . he 's entitled to do as he pleases and you and i are entitled to not care for it . this cd is not an acquired taste , it is a forced-feeding
1308,i got this as both a book and an audio file . i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author , but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts ( e.g. , i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell...what bible passage evidences this ? ) . i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations . where were his editors when this was being written ? why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities ? i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those " conservatives " frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on . i did appreciate his story about daniel and the " delayed " angel...but am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too . what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me . we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the bible well . so far...i may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself . i wonder if i can get a refund
1309," a provocative and surprising thriller . " ( fangoria ) yeah it is surprising , surprising-ly bad . it 's also provocative , it provoked me to write this bad review . from the beginning i could tell the director , chris fisher , was attempting to create a stylistic film . however , after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work i gave up . if you 're using style , have a reason . style without reason is not style . this film is one thing , if nothing else , a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots ( also known as crossdisolving shots ) . drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you 'll get the same effect as the camera work / editing of the film . there 's so much overlapping shots in this film , there 's probably 2 1 / 2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is . it 's full of tallent , bad tallent . it 's more about naked women , sex , and drugs than the actual story . i expected a cheap nock-off of the life of david gale . i would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this . this is bad , annoyingly bad . some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing . annette davey , the editor , should have her name removed from the film . unless , for some unknown reason , she 's proud of her work . if i was studio head at silver nitrate entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film , i 'd have everyone and anyone associated with it fired , immediately without question . sony pictures home entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film . if you enjoy good movies and great camera work , stay away from this film
1310,poser user since version 3. poser continues to improve . more life-like , faster
1311,i am teaching myself japanese . i want to learn more languages . i learned german , french , and korean . i want to learn korean . because i have a friend who speaks korean . this software is very awesome ! ! ! this can really help students who are taking french or spanish to get a good review . if you find a language you want to learn from this software.. . good luck with your studies and have fun
1312,i admit that my expectations were totally wrong concerning this film . i was expecting a spanish reworking of noel coward 's famous play about the dead returning to humorously haunt the living . the advertising for volver in the local media certainly led me to have this expectation . maybe this is why i found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing . but even on it 's own terms i found volver a difficult movie to enjoy . others see a celebration of strong women . i see a movie about murder , incest , deceit and theft . every main character here is a criminal . raimunda , her mother , her daughter , all commit one crime or another , some truly monstrous . who is there to admire ? this is empowerment ? i 'm trying to avoid spoilers here but suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this whole film . aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a director as experienced as almodovar should have produced a tighter work than this . there are numerous loose plot threads here . the whole subplot concerning the jerry springer-like tv show did n't really make any sense . the restaurant owner seems to like raimunda but nothing comes of this . in fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out , with no resolution . when the movie ended my first thought was " what , that 's it ? it 's over ? " . people might say " well , life has loose ends " but this is a movie , not life . it should have an ending . i know i 'm definitely in the minority concerning volver . my wife thinks i 'm nuts for not liking this film but i really think the emperor has no clothes here
1313,this camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to pc via usb . however , the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus , which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion . the clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation . we returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect , but the second unit had the same problem . apparently , according to the manual , this is " not a malfunction "
1314,i am very satisfied with nizoral anti-dandruff shampoo . many anti-dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough . i have thick , waist-length hair and nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage . unlike some anti-dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell , nizoral has a pleasant fragrance . i 'll definitely use this product any time i need a dandruff shampoo
1315,i love readding calvin and hobbes . best cartoon from the newspaper and great books . what a great imagination the writer is .
1316,anime studio 5 is surprisingly powerful . fairly easy to get started with and appears to have a lot of power waiting to be exploited .
1317,i recently purchased this cd again . i once owned it on cassette . keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music and sound has sustained very well since it was released in the early 90's . if you are building an old school collection with great singers this is a good one to have . it 's great for romance or with that special lady . jaye price beltsville md
1318,othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time . seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times . in the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done . the story of othello is that of a venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman . the general happens to be black . in an effort to sabotage the general , iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death . while shakespeare gives motivations for his characters , interpretations and emphases tend to vary . kenneth brannagh 's production of othello emphasies iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so . this production , with ian mckellan in the role of iago , puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight . both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in " being bad " wheras the latter seems more inclined to " get even " . both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure . the role of desdemona is portrayed in this version by imogen stubb and she is a delight to watch . she bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic . so too is the title role played admirably . the problem with othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence . this is a fine performance all around with a difficult play . if you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check , it is well worth the time
1319,the new look is very nice . but , when you install , you have also to keep the previous version ( in well behaved software , automatically the previous version is cleaned.. . not here ) . the system of validation of license through internet for the physical machine is fine , i just hope that i will not have a disk crash and then waste time to be authorised to re-install a product that i rightfully paid ( and at such a price ) . well , make sure you : - do not try to de-install 5 , 5 after the install of cs2 ( or bye-bye the license ) - have a clean and robust backup of your installation... . i am not sure i will make the next upgrade... .
1320,after installing in sony vgc-ra810 system crashed . unable to find c: . have been waiting two days for a legitimate answer from i0l0 and now have two case ##. phone attempts are met with automated replys the same as the internet . the amazon seller has been very helpfull so i can not blame him . if i ever get my computer running i plan on visiting all sites that support reviews with a word of advice about lack of human product support by iolo . as for now i wanted to get this out to amazon customers so i am using my neighbors computer
1321,i ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did . i have a stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade , an extra battery , and an extra picture card . there are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover . in the main compartment , a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money . ( it wo n't fit much more than that , though . ) it 's compact , stylish and functional- -i 'm glad i bought it
1322,i have tried nearly all brands of energy bars . hooah ! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ
1323,sigourney weaver is even better in this smash hit sequel to alien.fifty-seven years after her last escapade , ripley is found by a deep salvage team and taken back to earth.met with skepticism and ridicule when she tells of her encounter with the creature , she recievs information that colonists on lv-426 , the planet they landed on in the first film , have been missing.so , she and a group of high-tech marines go in to investigate.unfortunatly , the marines weapons are no match for the might of the thousands of aliens roaming the planet.ripley finds a renegade 7 year old named newt hiding in the sewers , and takes her under her arm.it all leads up to ripley 's showdown with the queen , and possibly her last.this is the best in the series
1324,my boy ejd is back , and so am i ! keeping it real , i took an eric jerome dickey hiatus . for years he held a special spot on my shelf as my favorite author , hands down . then it happened...his books just were n't doing it for me anymore . call in change , call it growth , falling off , call it whatever , but i was n't feeling it . drive me crazy drove me crazy and i could n't finish it . unheard of for me . chasing destiny came , but i let her run right past me . however , the title of his new release piqued my interest , so i decided to give it a shot and i am glad i did . death is life . gideon is a freelance hit man . in the seedy underbelly of death for hire , gideon is know as a man of talent and business ; a profitable business . he has a goal that he is trying to reach and with this acceptance of his most recent job , he just may obtain it . this job could put him over the edge financially and literally . has the hunter become the hunted ? sleeping with strangers is a smartly written , great reading drama / thriller that showcases dickey 's talent . he blended success , style and heartlessness . then he added some ruthlessness , deceit and trickery . let 's not forget murder , mayhem and steamy sex scenes . my hiatus is officially over . i enjoyed sws . now i ` m at the door , looking out the peephole waiting on the sequel to arrive
1325,i like this small thing . work great and cheap
1326,do not buy this iron . it 's fabulous while it works , for which it does merit the one star . but it broke in less than a week . it overheated , or something , and then would n't turn on again . but here 's the kicker : if you buy it from amazon , the company wo n't honor the warranty . i do n't have particularly heavy-duty hair . this is just totally unacceptable .
1327,if you have read harmon 's acting resume online , then you know she has talent , she has the training , and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along . but being a mild conservative ( angie is a republican ) in liberal hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at . good advice was bad advice for her . it is miscast with two annoying stars ; sheen and richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie . it has no redeaming values at all and angie deserves better roles then this . this movie was made by artiscan films , which recently went into bankruptcy and is now lions gate films , their films are still bad no matter the name change , and i still wait to see a better movie come to angie harmon
1328,homesite is widely recognized as " the " premier tool for coding html , client side , and server side code by hand . adding it to your resume wo n't land you a job , but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap , wysiwyg junkie . one of the things i like best about homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in asp.net . i was able to find a plug-in , which when added to homesite , recognized the .net tags and colors them accordingly . there are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there . if you are unfamiliar with homesite , are considering a purchase , but are not sure it 's the right tool for you , here 's a very brief description on how it works : this is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you . it is , in essence , a text editor on steroids . as you code by hand it will color the code for you , tell you when you 've made errors , offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean , has a built in ftp client , helps you organize your work into projects , and a bunch of other functions i 've never used . here 's the main thing you need to know : if you 're a homesite pro , then you are also a real developer . to everyone who has whined about lack of support : what do you expect for less then $100 ? if you purchase a flagship product from macromedia such as dreamweaver , studio mx , or fireworks , you 'll get all the support you 'll need . also , i 've been able to find plenty of free support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development . for every problem or question i 've found someone who knows the solution . you can too ! ! ! just a note : amazon is behind the times . from the macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what amazon is offering . well worth the $99.00
1329,let 's make this clear.. . i wo n't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself . so this is going to be short and sweet ! this book is a glorified magazine . worth $14.95 - tops . the pitfalls of bookbuying online , i guess . you never know what you are going to get . anyways , most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared . the text portion , however brief , is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared . the uninitiated might even be led to believe that kodak and konica are the only game in town in infrared films . throughout the book the author treats these two as the & quot ; coke and pepsi&quot ; of infrared films . i 'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same
1330,i wanted to buy this for my daughter . i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby . the outside is precious , but once you open it , the pages are like a black and white newspaper material , and they have no structure what so ever . the pages are boring and do n't look very durable
1331,this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well . the build is solid ( metal construction ) . the glass is also descent quality . about the performance , it absorbs some uv light . the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me . now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . i 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light / night situation . the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong / bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . to put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides / corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . and if the light is n't too bright / contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . but the point that i 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection does n't happen all the time during low light or night time . additionally , the internal reflection is n't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side / dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . i 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens . and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do n't have any filter for your lens yet .
1332,maybe i am not smart enough for this book , it certainly is n't for the novice ! ! i ended up more confused than educated
1333,well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work i 've decided to write my own review . i believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip , i just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types , to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks , nothing that has n't been told a thousand times over . when i first hearsd sugar ray back in 97 i thought their sound was revolutionary , i bought floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album , then the third , fourth , and fifth albums came out , the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that were n't radio friendly such as glory , personal space invader , and burning dog ; and with the release of their fourth album i bought it as well , hoping that they would get back on formula ; yes as you might of guessed i was delusional ; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....now with the release of their fifth album , they had already lost me as a fan so therefore , i give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1 / 5 stars for lack of originality
1334,i read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me , that 's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again . oh boy am i glad i bought it ! since last time i read it i have read many romance novels , many great one and many bad ones too . i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong . this book still made my heart race , made me smile at joe 's attempts to make ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them . joe 's character was just amazing , and most endearing was his insecurities.here was a navy seal , one of the toughest possible guys , and he was insecure about his upbringing and background . he felt veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him . he was sooooo sweet . he was so cocky , stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from veronica . just goes to show how a person 's outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them . i ca n't find any more book of this series , i am still searching for them . i know i have to read all of them .
1335,this album was one of my biggest " mistakes " ( bought it 3 years ago ) . it 's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative-rock-band . better you buy instead : up the bracket ( the libertines ) or some strokes-stuff. .
1336,clif bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars i have ever tried . they may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands , but there have been times where i could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture
1337,king vidor 's rather contrived adaptation of tolstoy 's epic riddled with miscast actors , a boring script , and a hurried screenplay . in short , another one of those 50-year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into hollywood 's vaults of oblivion . the story follows the main characters of tolstoy 's novel such as natasha ( audrey hepburn ) , prince andrei ( mel ferrer ) , and pierre ( henry fonda . ) the film is too short for the novel and the acting stinks : particularly that of henry fonda as pierre . henry fonda is as stiff as fossilized wood in this film ; his pondering stare and preaching voice reminds me of a bad charleton heston film . as far as the battle scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer , they are as sparse as they are realistic . all of the costumes and props in this film are horribly fake . in short , the only thing that remains impressive about this film is the fact that hollywood bothered to put it on dvd . apart from that , the acting is as worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue . do n't buy this film
1338,i have been a microsoft money user for many , many years . ( going back to money ' 98 ? i forget . ) i reluctantly upgraded to money 2007 premium earlier this year from money 2004 when i read somewhere that money 2004 was no longer going to be supported . ( i also read that money 2005 , money 2006 , and money 2007 had issues . hence my reluctance to upgrade . ) for years , i have sync'ed money with my online accounts on nearly a daily basis . i 'm that kind of focused on keeping my eye on my money , and money has historically served me very well in this habit . money 2007 does not . since installing it , i have : 1 ) battled with my prior bank for nearly two months to get them to figure out by money 2007 does not synchronize with their systems . 2 ) installed and reinstalled money 2007 on several different workstations to test the synchronization issue with my years-old money file and new , empty money files . always fails . 3 ) now i have *switched banks* thinking the syncing issue was my bank 's fault . it wasn't . it 's microsoft money 's fault . syncing fails *every* time with a helpful obres 22063 error . oh , yea , that one ! we all know just what that is . i have read every microsoft knowledge base article i can find . i have perused public.microsoft.money and other usenet groups . i have googled . i have read blogs . the only thing i find is that lots of people have this problem with lots of different financial institutions , and microsoft is doing nothing about it in money 2004 , this worked flawlessly nearly every time . why did it break ? ! ? ! ! so if you 're looking to have money synchronize with your accounts online , look elsewhere . but if you 're all about putting everything in manually , this product will serve you just fine . buy a copy of quicken instead !
1339,this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy . a year after this book was published , there were over a hundred reviews . regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author , finds the author right or wrong , interesting or boring , this book is one of the most influential books , if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy . in fact , the current bush adminstration 's policies , george kenan 's containment , henry kissinger 's policies as well as countless adminstration 's policies are shaped or affected by this book . my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments , and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book . it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations , differing on extent . ( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after ) . it is a fascinating book and hard to put down . the author writes in a european style ( beautiful long sentences , etc. ) , which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read . he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically . ms. rice and mr. kissinger were heavily influenced by this book . to understand them , this is a must read . in and of itself , it is an excellent book , a classic , and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it . look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists
1340,this program does exactly as i expect . i am very pleased
1341,i have windows vista home premium and i tryed four diferent antivirus from diferent companies and no one works well i have programs conflicts and lot of errors on my laptop , and then i bought norton 360 and work wonderful , this norton realy protects your computer and detected malicious internet pages is a good security for my lap and my privacy . i 'm happy and my laptop too now works just like when i boght it 2 mounths a g
1342,the synopsis ... sam and jonah baldwin , father and son , have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer . seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of chicago , they move to seattle . eighteen months later , jonah can sense that his dad is still sad ; and , in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on christmas eve to wish for his father a new wife . annie reed lives in baltimore and is engaged to walter . their relationship , while loving and comfortable , is entirely devoid of romantic sparks . when annie hears jonah 's soulful plea on the radio , it 's as if her heart has been touched by " magic " and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across " like 26 states " . the critique ... sleepless in seattle is a brilliantly simple film ; that 's what makes it so great . to quote nora ephron , " it is n't a movie about love , it 's a movie about love in the movies . " to emphasize this point , she incorporates various parallel references to " an affair to remember " throughout the film ; but , sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love ( which , let 's admit it , have been undeniably shaped by what we 've seen on the silver screen ) . the script is refreshingly candid , yet endearing and nora ephron 's direction is impeccable . ross malinger , cast as jonah baldwin , is the youngest and most notable talent in the film . he does an excellent job of portraying the quintessential eight-year-old ; he 's impulsive , moody and thinks he knows it all . ( i speak from experience here folks ; i currently have a son that age . ) he and tom hanks come together flawlessly as father and son ; so successfully in fact , that they would be utterly convincing off screen . the chemistry between meg ryan and tom hanks is equally amazing , which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene . the supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes rosie o'donnell , bill pullman , rita wilson , rob reiner , david hyde pierce , and a young gaby hoffmann . families with younger children will appreciate the film 's integrity ; there is very little foul language ( " god damn it " and " ... it scared the shit out of me ... " being the worst of it ) and no " sexual content " to be wary of . all around , this is a winning film . one that i find myself watching over and over and over again . the dvd ... for a 10th anniversary edition , the special features are few and rather disappointing . you 've got your basic director commentary , a music video ( " when i fall in love " by celine dion & clive griffin ) , and a " love in the movies " featurette . this last piece is approximately 15 minutes long . it features the director , producers , actors and the hosts of loveline : drew pinsky and adam carolla ( why they are included , i do n't know ) talking about " love in the movies . " there are some interesting interview segments with an empire state building historian and some very beautiful shots of the new york skyline before 9 / 11 ; but there 's certainly nothing here to write home about . by far , the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio . ( and honestly , how exciting is that ? ) this a dvd that you buy for the film alone .
1343,this book is a sure snooze-fest . luckily for me i did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class . we read selected chapters of the book . they writing was horrible . many parts were unclear . i had to reread what i read over and over . i ca n't stand this style of writing . barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent . instead , he comes off as boring and pretentious . skip this book.. . try something else
1344,after i watched this sequel i realized it was not as good as the first but i did enjoy it .
1345,the best thing i can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results . the actual results varied greatly from those i received from my doctor 3 months prior : ( ... ) both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast . all instructions were followed . i find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months . i contacted biosafe customer service . all representatives were busy on my first call so i left a message , which was not returned . i called again and was able to speak to someone right away . the customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods ( finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm ) will vary " slightly " . ( ... ) i question the accuracy of the biosafe results .
1346,first of all , let me say this product is great in almost every way . so if you need to feel better about your nose and / or throat , go for it . my main complain about the grossan hydro pulse is that it is noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided to produce his own machine and , if i 'm right , viajet is making it for him . viajet sells the same machine , except for the grossan tip , at about -again - a half the price of the hydro pulse . the breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive ( i have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country ) . so what makes the hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health is a business , after all . other than that , like i have said , this product is great for almost any respiratory problem . i used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle , and is intended to use it over 50 times . the hydro pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime , so you get the idea . also , if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment , look for the buteyko method
1347,i was very happy with the product . it serves me well . fast delivery , good service by the vender . i got the project done and it will serve me well on into the future . great travel storage case , heavy plastic unit . good quality light stands
1348,the filters that i got are poorly finished . the 812 filter has a smudge on it , while all 3 filters do n't screw on properly on my lens . all filters come off easily . they are totally useless . i suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens
1349,good singing and good production must i say anything else ? .....no get this if you love mixtures of good uptempo and slow rn
1350,this is a terrific cookbook , even for people like me who are not trained bakers . i have succeeded in making three recipes already- -they work great . have a long way to go to try a lot of other really inviting recipes . her book also serves as a great reference for anything chocolate . i was quite impressed with the fact that ms. lonbotham pays an historical homage to chocolate decadence ( page 42 ) as being a seminal contribution to chocolate lovers worldwide . living in berkeley at the time , i well remember what a sensatation it caused .
1351,if you think you 'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting , then you 'll enjoy this book .
1352,this album is pure crap ! just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from straight outta cashville , until he can make a real new album , not this microwaved crapola . if you like buck , get straight outta cashville , an beg for mercy , than wait for his future release , with actual new tracks . i strongly advise you not to buy this . it is a total rip off . i wasted my time downloading this

1354,i saw dead ringers in the movies . the theater was filled with mostly couples . when it was over , as we walked out , laughter began to spread as we all recognized that we as couples were having the same conversation ; " whose stupid idea was it to pay money to see this move " !
1355," all men can do anything , if they will " seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture , carefully directed by agnieszka holland , one of the major female directors in the world . this absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters . on one hand , our little girl will know the world is not turning around her ; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true , and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life . a triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the nineties .
1356,this is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction . out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts , away from the creepy angst of punks . this wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women , looking and acting sexy , and leading productive , respectable lives . why not portray lesbians as beautiful , educated , clean , classy , talented , sober , drug-free , non-violent , non - " self-destructive " , straight forward , honest...oh , and truly sexy ? ? the reno landscape in the 50 's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered . the filming is top notch , the sets and period clothing are spot on . the musical scores are superb ! the cast was wonderful ! charbonneau and shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other . just a masterful duette of performances ! cay , free and fully out , forward and knowing just what she wants ; vivian , tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box . every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension . two georgeous women making love ? ? hello ! the love scene is landmark . audra lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as cay 's stepmom . cay 's best friend , silver , is absolutely a key role in the dynamics of these chracters ; she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people , and deserve love and happiness . we all need a little " silver " in our lives ! ! this story is completely intriguing , and hey , what a wonderful ending ! sequel , sequel ! ! ! this is an absolute must have in any collection . timeless tale of the beauty of lesbian love .
1357,someone wanted to make indiana jones part 4 , starring tom hanks and created a such puzzled labyrinth that i think the book author would n't be able to tell the whole story without looking into his notes . after watching this movie it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that you have vaisted 2 hours on nonsense . 5 stars for special effects
1358,it does n't get any better than this . this album is a must have for all true judas priest fans . this is priest when they were really getting good . the guitars and the vocals rock you to the core
1359,i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower . even though that 's possible , the very last thing this product does is remove hair - - at least with the epilator head . the shaving head works fairly well , but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better . i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective
1360,thought the cards would be like broderbund 's american gretings creatacard platinum 8 software but it was not and i did not like what i got .
1361,at first , i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church . yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story , especially since i work as a mental health professional . as i keep reading , i discovered that it was n't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope , of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child , and of the intrusive nature of the media . i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict , despite her past history of nervous breakdown . and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man . the secondary characters were all wonderful , in particular mariah 's mother and the lawyers on both side . i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story . as with all picoult books , this was a deep and heavy novel which was n't easily breezed through , but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read !
1362,this lens has extremely fast ( and quiet ) focus , and is razor sharp . what more could you want , when photographing wildlife up close
1363,this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [...] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?
1364,ive read many endtimes outlines . tcp isnt any good . go to fortbethel.com under books for much better guides . tcp put me to sleep
1365,i purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it . well made with good trim length settings , it 's also easy to hold . recommended
1366,i 've bought several lenses from adorama , two of which include a new 300 / 2.8 is and the other , this 500 / 4 is . all of their deliveries were prompt and well packed . i have zero complaints with them . i dealt the john ( green , i think is his last name ) via email . i highly recommend them . as for this lens , it is incredible . wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background ( good bokeh ) . af is very fast . this lens is extremely good and will still af when used with the 1.4x converter . ( af works up to f5.6.
1367,the service was good and it came undamaged and the product was easy to use and it has been very satisfactory for my needs . the description of the product was accurate
1368,this is the jacksons second album for epic and producers gamble and huff . it would be their last with gamble and huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should . music 's takin over , different kind of lady and do what you wanna are great , catchy dance tracks . the real greatness here lies in the ballads where michael 's voice is in peak form . even though you 're gone and find me a girl are classic ballads . so good , i feel that find me a girl is probably the best michael jackson song you 've never heard . this is probably michael jackson 's most overlooked album and its one of his best ! the jacksons all sing together great and you can see why destiny and triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded . overall , great ballads , catchy feel good dance tracks , and michael jackson singing his heart out . get this , you will not be dissaponted
1369,if you want to write a great script , never ever once think of it as anything other than telling a solid story . this book advances the theory that writing for animation is different than writing . it isn't .
1370,leary is a hack . he was n't " influenced " by bill hicks , he stole material . that makes him a hack . how can you leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack ? take it up with webster 's dictionary . the exact bits leary stole are described in the book american scream on pages 201-202. bill hicks was incensed when he heard leary 's tape . on behalf of bill 's memory , give credit to the original .
1371,pictures via camera reflect not only what the photographer sees , but what he thinks about . the most successful reflect an understanding of things as much as their image , and jerry thompson 's exploration of the relationship between seeing and thinking in truth and photography provides a set of fine duotone photos to illustrate essays reflecting on working photography experiences
1372,let 's get one thing straight - radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the beatles . that said , this is not the album for that reason . do not let this album turn you off from radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about . there is one hint though in where radiohead will go . in the song " creep " , which is not a fantastic song , there is a brilliant " chu-chunk " made by johnny greenwood . so please - if you are trying to get into radiohead...go somewhere else . for the " rockers " - get the bends , for people trying to expand their musical mind - get ok computer , and if you like that you may become obsessed with kid a . there are some unbelievable songs on amnesiac , but it is not their most cohesive album , and hail to the theif is very solid . thank you for your time
1373,two of us read this book and we were both disappointed . characters are depressing and annoying . the storyline is predictable . we both loved john 's two last books but fiction is not his forte . i would not recommend this book to anyone
1374,i have to give philippa gregory a big thank you ! for approaching this story from a different perspective from the other boleyn girl . it delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of english royalty and wealth . again i was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events . there were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end , i was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book . so if you are deciding whether or not you 'd like to read this after having read the other boleyn girl , i greatly encourage you to do so , you wo n't regret it
1375,with these weights i was able to send my canon powershot s70 to the bottom of the atlantic , and i have great faith that they will keep it there . reliable , and more professional than a brick
1376,i bought this software because i really wanted to learn spanish and be fluent . the price and marketing of the company made me believe that this package was the most complete package on the market . so i was very excited to receive it after spending $450 on a software . my excitement did not last long after that . i was shocked to see how the software itself looked , i was expecting a top of the line interface for the price i paid but that software seemed years old . but i still wanted to get my money worth so tried the first level for hours , even days , as i was convinced i could learn spanish with it . i also tried the other 2 levels to make sure that my issue was not only with that first level . i had looked at the demo and noticed that most of the content was based on that same acitivity with the 4 pictures . i was expecting different exercises for the full version...the software gets so repetitive , i was really disappointed , even more because of the outrageous price of that package
1377,when i ordered this item , i assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use . actually , each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it , to be used once and discarded . let me see : a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365 , 000 , 000 plastic doodads added to the world 's landfills every year . i already compromise my principles for convenience more than i 'd like to admit . this is totally over the top . when i 've used up my supply of flossers , out this thing goes . it goes into the landfill , to be sure . so do n't anyone else make my mistake
1378,i run two websites using this program , easy learning curve , i recommend it to all my newbie friends that need a simple , workable program . ignore the crittics , this is a nice program.only wish in batch editing i could do multiple web page saves .
1379,i bought this cd six months ago because i am a miami vice fan . i did n't expect it to be good , but it is wonderful . & quot ; in dulce decorum&quot ; is incredible ! this is a hard-to-find cd . you will love it ! i enjoy it more with each playing
1380,i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks . i love the wheel , but darn if this is n't just terrible . there is n't even a single on it ; i ca n't believe the studio released it . thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store . the catherine wheel needs to get back together- -quick
1381,let me the say that the vocals on this cd may be painful at first , yet you get over them very quickly , except for a few spots . even so , they do not lower my score for the album , and at times are quite catchy . savage - good riffs , good solos , catchy , purely driven madness to start this insane album . 93 / 100 where my fortune lies - the intro is absolutely nuts , and the highlight of the song . probably my least favorite after this , yet the solos are still out of this world . 87 / 100 ninja - what a great song ! the intro is one of the greatest things i have heard in my life , and this song may actually have you humming along at points . ninja ! very well laid out , and the solos at the end are the best so far on the album . brilliance . 97 / 100 concerto - amazing once again , and becker the 17 year old prodigy showcases himself throughout . he proves he is the master of sweeping and arpreggios all over this album , and this song is an insane instrumental that captures melodies like none other . more notes played in 4 1 / 2 minutes than in george harrison 's entire career . 98 / 100 burn the ground - fastest on the album solo wise in fact becker is so fast it is hard to believe that its human . very melodic too except when there are vocals , the song is kinda of disgusting . 87 / 100 desert island -another amazing song very well laid out with great solos and great riffs . the outro is the perfect intro to speed metal symphony . the vocals are actually good on this song , like ninja . , an entertaining song . 97 / 100 speed metal symphony - nine minutes of shredding and arpreggios and all kinds of melodic madness that is beauty to any shredder 's ears . everything about this song is good . 97 / 100 there is n't much to say about this album except becker and friedman show they are true masters of their instruments and are able to play in a melodic and listenable way . i would recommend this over yngwie malmsteen , who has not improved since his first album
1382,i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book . this is not a book about cosmology ( as people would expect from roger penrose ) . in this tiny book , penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes ( something much different from the opinion of 99 , 99% of neurobiologists , such as steven pinker ) . this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann . the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories ( thus , the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works ! ) . some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they did n't had in mind that this book is about penrose 's point of view on intelligence . in fact , i 'm not a physicist , nor a biologist , simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand , although i do not agree with penrose 's point of view . i think he forgot something very important . read it and read the other point of view and you 'll find what it is ! :
1383,i first viewed this movie on cable , that same night , i purchased the movie from this seller . to date , i have had no responses to email , no communication what so ever , and still have not received this tape in the mail . very disappointed , and not recommended to purchase from this seller
1384,this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical . a better alternative would be to listen to either : a ) the original artists who influenced this band or b ) someone at least trying to do something new with music . to enjoy this cd you 'd have to really want to like this band , either because you liked dig or because you 're attracted to their super-cool reputation . if you 're afraid you 're missing out on something by not owning bjm 's back catalogue do n't worry , you 're not .
1385,( this review is of the spyware edition ) nis takes 25megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one ( if you have & lt ; 256megs your lightweight cpu ca n't carry enough armor to make windows really zero-day net safe imho ) nis has most of the features i look for in a firewall / spyware / virus scanner / intrusion detector , but half do n't work right , and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work . even after liveupdate this week , one buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded , and port 80 was open listening half ' naked ' on the internet . i replaced it , and at the first passing probe my rule was erased , autoreplaced , naked again . only after i stumbled onto the secret trick ( add a block all rule after the pass rules ) did it close it . it took 11 clicks ( ! ) just to add the block all rule - miserable ! the log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining " permitted once " 200 times , no actual info until i click on one of them . what 's worse is , none of them i checked were " permitted once " iirc . nis detected 2 trojan / spywares , but could not remove either . enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups , all suggesting i block access , but i actually do want ie to access the internet . running windows update brought a popup asking if 100 's more dll 's are ok . how would i know ? i do want windows updated . great feature in theory , totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented . if you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset , plan to either " permit all " or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand tcp vs udp etc. why no " permit all local + dns + outbound port 80 " choice ? that would mean 1 / 10 the work ! jetico lets me pick " web browser " ruleset , so its ui from hell gets used once per category . after spending all day and half the night getting it working , i discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them . i would be less furious if i had a fresh install of windows , but not much . all good , until a program autoupdates , and 3 more rules to write . too angry for words . jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig . i would not use nis if you paid me 10 times its price .
1386,i would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb . quite frankly i would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just reburning these cd 's and reselling them . for 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite
1387,in this sixth ( but not final ) installment of the movie series , what we get is little story and too much senseless action ( with a sprinkling of hot tub sex ) . this is a very disappointing film . although it is the last such lwnc movie from this creative team , it does not end the storyline ( with 28 volumes in the manga series , we probably would have needed another 3-7 films ) . so the patient , constant viewer gets instead a hack-and-slash film of mid-caliber . the ending - - an over-extending action sequence set on a snowy slope - - is very unsatisfying ; so are the characters : unlike other lwnc films , we do not get to meet any new incidental characters . as a result , the film is less about " edo " soceity ( which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team ) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen...waiting , waiting to happen . the film is way too long and its pacing is horrible . i think the fault with the film lies in these two things : 1 ) the writers / filmmakers chose poor source material . the " five wheel " assassin team denies itto and son the chance to mingle with regular edo joes . as a result , you do not get as i argued the best part of the series : the rich detail of edo life . 2 ) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with james bond films like " on her majesty 's secret service " and whatnot with their decision to make this movie " samurai on skis " . after the first few minutes of fighting on the snow , i was thinking " enough already , i get it : samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces ! " watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment
1388,this book is pretty much useless if you 're looking for info on how to build a dulcimer . only about 60 pages of it actually talks about dulcimer making / repair . the rest is a long winded history / bio of homer ledford . some of that is a bit interesting from an historical / cultural perspective , but the author beats it to death . homer wanted the book to be just on how to build and care for a dulcimer ; the rest was the author 's idea . dean kimball 's book on dulcimer making is better , although still lacking in some areas . this book has no patterns or plans , few useful photos , and is weak in what instruction it does provide . there are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the book
1389,i had read- -with delight- -the book called " mrs. frisby and the rats of nimh " to my grandsons , so i thought the movie would be a nice followup . wrong ! it barely resembles the book , and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out . it might be ok for a child who has n't read the book , but we were disappointed
1390,whether you 're planning to read through crowley 's book of thoth for the first time , or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it , this book is going to be equally useless to you . several of crowley 's diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly , but sadly that 's the only good thing about this book . the book is filled with a lot of fluff . duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley 's and harris ' lives , and constantly excuses and defends crowley 's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper . duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley 's works , so perhaps its some sort of atonement . but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley 's character . through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems . having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid . unfortunately duquette does n't do this . his background information is base and scarce . he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah , but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this , duquette does n't give nearly enough information to understand crowley 's works , and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere . as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley 's work , duquette outright fails . at times it seems as if duquette does n't even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck . i do n't think the man even understands tarot in general ( and duquette 's own tarot deck is evidence of this too ) . at his best , duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth . typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette 's work , a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level . reading through the book of thoth , there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better . crowley 's phonetic translation of the i ching does n't follow the current standard , and sometimes the differences are confusing , especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching . a key showing crowley 's translation and the standard translation would 've been helpful . likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology , despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth , and what he did write is hard to find . a chapter explaining crowley 's views on astrology would 've been great . if that was n't possible , then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful . however duquette 's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read . duquette 's book is n't useful as a reference to crowley 's work . duquette does n't seem to understand crowley most of the time , and fails to adequatley explain crowley 's ideas . besides some new-agey nonsense , like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays , duquette does n't offer any new ideas or insights into crowley 's work . except for a few nice diagrams ( which are common enough and easy to find ) , there is n't anything worthwhile contained in this book . at least not anything you wo n't get out of reading crowley 's book of thoth
1391,i am a retired senior software engineer ( web development ) . i 've used many antivirus / malware packages both at work and at home . this is the absolute worst . after installing it , i got popup virus alerts from bitdefender every 10 seconds . no kidding . i could n't believe it . i previously had a copy of norton antivirus 5 on my computer which is highly reliable ( not like the latest version ) . i tried bitdefender based on the reviews below which were obviously written by people with less than standard operating systems . i use a pc with windows xp sp2 and ie6 ( ie7 is still buggy ) . although multiple runs of bitdefender show absolutely no viruses or malware on my system , i continue to get these popup " virus alerts " every 10 seconds when i browse the internet , which is way more irritating than anything norton ever did to my computer . in addition , it drags my computer to almost a screeching halt when i go to a web page i have n't been to in more than a day , sometimes even the ones i just went to an hour ago . i find this truly irritating and went to bitdefender 's website and tried their online chat . " jack " was completely worthless . he told me to completely wipe out my cookies , as well as a lot of other useful files for no apparent reason other than he 's probably not named jack , but something like vishnu and this was the first thing on a long list of things to tell people to do . very useless . not recommended for anyone . try to get an old copy of norton antivirus 5 and pay for the update feature ( $20 per year ) . much better than this garbage . in addition , there are virtually no options to customizing this product . you 're stuck with what they think is necessary ( like automatically deleting internet files you may need- -like shopping carts ) . it literally cripples your computer .
1392,there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album . one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time . it was the first rock album recorded on a 16 track . in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology . the remaster is splendid . another good reason is the great bonus tracks . almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store . can you dig it
1393,the video editing part of this software is completely useless . it did n't come with a manual and i ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it . it has n't made a difference . the software is completely uncooperative . my computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program . if you bought this software for the video editing , i recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else
1394,there is only one 100% whole grain bread recipe in this book . most of them are less than 50% whole grain . if you want healthy bread recipes try " breadtime " by cheney or " the laurel 's kitchen bread book " by robertson . every recipe in both of those books is 100% whole grain . i doubt that most people considering a book titled " whole grain breads.. . " are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients . with that being said i thought the book had some good recipes and was well written . therefore , i am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none .
1395,this year , 60% of college entries will be female . look at this spring 's honor role listings . last year , 78% of honor role members in my community were female . schools are fails boys - not girls . if you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap , then get this book . if you want to really improve the quality of education , there are thousands of reads better than this
1396,these guys are the best group out right now . every single rapper is amazing even bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics . this album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including sh*t can happen , pistol pistol , ai n't nuttin ' but music , american psycho , fight music & revelation . my favorite rappers are swifty & eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now ( besides em , only proof ( r.i.p. ) & bizarre do.. . which are my least favorite rappers in the group ) every song is great even the skits are enjoyable . if you do n't have this yet , you are missing out on one of the best cds ever
1397,this is the first cd i 've bought in the liquid mind series , but after hearing this one , i 'll buy more . the music is calming and soothing ; great to fall asleep by which i often do . it lulls you into a peaceful state of relaxation , letting your mind drift away from the cares of the day . it makes me think of floating on a cloud . i would highly recommend this cd for anyone with a busy , stressed-out life .
1398,i bought this item over a year ago , and it has never served for anything . once i spotted a deer and turned on the " ir " illuminator , and the deer ran away - not too surprising , it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals . better use a flashlight . this is a first-generation nightscope , and has a very small range of utility : if there is a little light , the adapted human eye sees better , and if there is almost no light the device does not see either . 100 bucks is not too much of a waste , but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much
1399,i work for a dept . with the state government and grote 's comprehensive performance management system was implemented several years ago . it works . takes the indecision and inconsistency out of perform . mgt . this text is excellent . i found that it was easy to read and to apply . we also use grote 's discipline without punishment ( dwop ) system also . i recommend his book of the same title also . excellent system .
1400," doctor livingstone i presume ? " is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history . very few people , however , are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of dr. david livingstone and henry morton stanley . this book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together . livingstone , one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the nile river . through a combination of bad luck , poor planning , disease , weather , natives , etc. , livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of lake tangyanika . henry stanley , a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher . this book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place . the perils of african exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated . this book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader . i found this book very similar in style and experience to undaunted courage ( which detailed the voyage of discovery undertaken by lewis and clark ) and river of doubt ( dealing with theodore roosevelt 's exploration of the amazon basin . if you enjoyed either of these books , you will like this one as well . if you read this book and enjoy it , i highly recommend the other two
1401,poison the well are one of those bands that i was really big on right when i first started listening to them , but which faded a lot pretty quickly . i ca n't really say why . i like their work , but it does n't inspire me the way it used to . still , i do like them , and this album particularly . maybe not as much as opposite of december , but whatever . yes , this is n't as ' hardcore ' as their older stuff , but i 've never been hardcore kiddie . ( i 'm a metalhead ) and frankly , being a modern hardcore band ai n't much of a compliment in my book . it 's funny , lotsa tech-metalcore and other ' core derived bands are good , but most straight hardcore / metalcore is staggeringly boring . so , while old ptw was semi-technical metalcore , this album is pretty much just extremely loud emo . but , they now how to be ' emotional ' and not come across as sissies , ( well , most of the time ) and jeff does n't sing in an unbearably affected manner . course , the ' extremely loud ' part helps a lot too , and jeff 's growls / screams are absolutely devastating . way better than on their previous albums , and some of the best extreme vox from anyone , ever . as an extremely heavy emo album , the instrumentation here is pretty bland . there is n't much real riffing going on , not in the metal sense anyway , mostly just a single note / chord repeated a great many times , than another one etc. but , the vox and atmospherics carry the day . the standout track is ' crystal lake ' , an absolutely bestial piece of deathcore . i 've listened to quite a bit of death metal in my day , but this has got to be one of the most devastating tracks i 've ever heard , largely because of the absolutely impassioned vox . lotsa extreme vox lack emotion , but never moeria 's ( probably spelling that wrong , sorry ) that , and the instruments are more noteworthy , very nasty and chaotic . also , it earns points for taking some of the seriousness out the genre with its jokey lyrics . ( for the culturally backward , this song is a first-person narrative from jason voorhees , killer of most of the ' friday the 13th ' films . hence the name ' crystal lake' . ) there are no truly weak tracks here . ' ghostchant ' is a good opener , nicely displaying the extreme tonal dichotomy of the album , mixing the fierce screams with some nice melodic vox . ' loved ones ' is one of the very best tracks , again carried almost entirely by the powerful vox . tracks 5 is a cool two part thing mixing the rather pleasant , harmonica and bass driven intro with one of the more hectic , grinding main songs . the album takes a turn for the lighter at about track 8. ' apathy is a cold body ' is a very emo-y track , but it 's got a lot of nice melody to it , so it works . ' sound like the end of the world ' is another strange one . it 's a slow doomy piece with oppressive atmosphere and a thick layering of vocal lines . not the best thing here , but it works and it earns some points for being different . yes , a solid , if not great album . check it out
1402,i have yet to read a true grisham thriller , but i plan to in the near future . having said that , i have no idea how this compares , but i did n't really care for it . it 's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that i could n't get into . i felt like i was reading a teen or children 's book , and i do n't like feeling so patronized when i read unless i knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message- -even then , i do n't usually feel patronized or " written down to " . it 's simple writing and a simple plot . it 's lighthearted and thus a light read . i imagine many people would enjoy it ; i just could n't get into it . :o
1403,have loved this album since it first came out years ago ( bought on vinyl - lost to the mists of time ) . the cd was out of print but i kept looking and found it on amazon ( it was re-released ) , yeah ! ! ! ! last steam engine , from the cradle to the grave , louise , owls , you do n't have to need me - some of my favorites . this , to me , is kottke in his prime
1404,i wouold only skim this book if you want a general idea about business marketing , but do not expect in depth detail about how to truly market your business
1405,this oregon scientific pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price . there is no point to even considering " saving money " when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary
1406,unfortunately i received the items damaged . the exterior postage box was unharmed but the paper boxes were obviously dropped at some point before packaging .
1407,i was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but i am so glad i did . this one gives me a really good shave . i have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since . another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud , which it is but since you turn it on and leave it , i just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem .
1408,it 's an interesting approach at what people will do for money . still , i hated it . john travolta was terrible [as usual]. lisa kudrow , who was the reason i watched this , was so incredibly unlike her role on " friends " as she was a murderous goldigging nympho-biatch who made you mad every time she was on screen . i was very disappointed with her performance . i ca n't believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a ... part . the other supporting actors were no good either with the exception of bill pullman , who was pretty funny as the " i could give a damn about it " cop . the best thing about this movie though , is the cute , gullible waitress named wendy who 's only on screen about five minutes throughout the entire film . anyway , skip this one . it was just plain awful
1409,this mix starts off heavy , and never lets up , with the quirky , yet hard hitting vocal track grace ( anxiety ) by troy pierce ( as louderbach ) starting things off in a very energetic way . this track worked well in sascha funke 's boogy bytes 2 mix , but it was deep into the mix . i feel it 's even more effective starting a mix off . things quickly lighten up with the bloopy claude vonstroke next , and then it 's into the m.a.n.d.y. remix of tiefschwarz 's excellent track damage , featuring tracey thorn of everything but the girl on vocals . two solid tech house tracks follow , especially touane 's snappy track bassic , and it 's right into the gritty , churning , techno sound of thomas schumacher 's incredible track rotor . the mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7 , which i feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix . it 's not bad , it 's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking . it 's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row , and right after the melodic freefall , it 's into tiefschwarz 's own remix of a depeche mode track . this is the only other slight miss in the mix for me , as i feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes , and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix . another solid melodic track is next , and we end with the dubbed out vocals of kate wax . overall , it 's an exciting tech house mix that 's a full lineup of solid tracks , with not a bad one in sight , and very few dips in the scorching pace of one , very sound , top to bottom mix . do not miss picking this one up , as it 's easily in the top 5 techno / tech house mixes this year
1410,this book contains the childhood memoirs of peter reich . as the son of psychoanalyst wilhelm reich , peter led a bizarre life . he lived with his parents on the family estate of orgonon in the backwoods of maine . not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy , but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy . as wilhelm 's only child , peter was one of the first recipients of reich 's therapy methods , which involved special forms of touch , energy channeling , " softening the stomach " , and inducing vomiting ( in peter 's account ) . peter was also made lieutenant in his father 's defensive squad that protected the earth from ufo attacks through the use of " accumulator guns " . the elder reich eventually got in trouble with the fda for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness . the court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court . not long after being sent to prison , he passed away , apparently of heart failure . upon his father 's death , peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father 's legacy of brilliance and madness . up until the time of his father 's death , he had believed everything his father told him , not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father 's version of reality was from most other people 's , nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father 's explanations and standard scientific approaches . in this book , peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not , what is his , and what is his father's . the book reads like the proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another . sometimes it 's hard to tell if what peter is describing actually took place , or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head . by the end of the book , the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in peter 's mind , but , like peter , may not be capable of saying what really happened . in any case , this is very much a book about peter reich , and not wilhelm reich , although readers who want to learn more about wilhelm reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son , who experienced them first hand and without question
1411,bob james - the mastermind of smooth jazz . " h " , " touchdown " , " grand piano cannyon " . eternal pieces of art. brave and thoughtful new directions in jazz . we owe him a lot . but the recent releases of fourplay -including " x " - do n't meet my expectations at all : predictable , repetitive , overproduced computer-music . the typical fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another cd . larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on " tournabout " - but then the song falls back again to old routine . " screenplay " is a good one ( one of two songs that were done by bob ) . the rest , hmm.. . some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy . do n't get me wrong , i like all of the guys . every single member of the group has done great things in the past . so - a bit more breveness , yes please
1412,true , there are many controversies raging about copying dvds and copyrights . i suspect we are in a transition zone with all this and " the industry " will figure out how to help people love and cherish their dvds rather than simply calling everyone a pirate . having said that , i can also understand why an author of such a book would n't want to " say too much " about this controversy , especially if he his looking over his shoulder at " the lawyers . " i was trying to think of an analogy to express my disapointment in this book ( and this is n't a good one ) but it goes like this : you want to go to israel and you buy a book on " israel for dummies " and you search for something , anything on the controversy of the wall they are building . but instead of finding a discussion of the controversy you find a few off-handed quips about " there 's a wall going up and it 's causing some controversy . ' nuff said . " " ' nuff said " ? hel-lo ? were dummies out here , that 's why we bought the dumb book ! there might be some useful information for some people , but i was sorely disappointed
1413,about the band : dead can dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre . in fact , the name of the label , 4ad , which carried many of the 1990s dcd releases , is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music , which is a fusion of subtle electronics , vocals , drums , world music , and a near limitless count of instruments . brendan perry sometimes has been described as a gothic frank sinatra . lisa gerrard 's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to lisa . i count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem . about the album : compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks , the 50-minutes of into the labyrinth would seem short , if it were n't for the fact that i like to listen to this album over and over again . i count this album as one of my all time favorites , and certainly my most prized dead can dance cd . one of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both lisa 's and brendan 's ghostly vocals . on some tracks they accompany each other , while others feature only one of the artist 's chilling or mystical sounding vocals . simply put , this is beautiful music to relax to . i honestly give this album my highest recommendations ! two tracks i 'd recommend sampling : " towards the within " ( featuring lisa 's vox w / brendan backing ) and " tell me about the forest " ( featuring brendan 's vox ) . i believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album . please note that while all the tracks feature vocals , the lyrics for only those sung in english are included in the liner notes . similar artists : chances are if you are n't yet familiar with dead can dance , that you 've not yet discovered some of these other bands , but i highly recommend them as well : das zeichen , impressions of winter , love is colder than death , qntal , corvus corax , or helium vola . there is a rather large ( and somewhat underappreciated ) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to dead can dance . please check some of them out as well .
1414,to be honest i ca n't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound i 've heard . for me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time , never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one . my favourite songs on the album are " the only moment we were alone " and " six days at the bottom of the ocean " every time my ears are blessed with these artworks i 'm am fixated on nothing else but them . i literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything i just have to listen to them intently . this album is not as experimental as " those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever " but i feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well , with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be . i love the pure , clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind . the trance that this album provides is indescribable ; i 'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note . either way i strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase , for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced , written , recorded , thought out and sounding . buy it , you will not regret your choice one bit .
1415,am i the only person that felt this book was twisted , disjointed , and something was just not working ? the beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired . this could have been a great story , the author veered off track or something
1416,a b / w film classic . excellent story and performances from all the stars , perhaps the acting style is a little dated . a very god qulaity transfer to dvd except for one scene that is a little grainy . i will watch this film again and again
1417,**things i liked about the program it supports importing ojb files , that i make in different modeling programs the walking path editor works not too bad for simulated walking and the rigs have good looking emontions when you moves there face features **what i found to be not so good the tabs such as the library and keyframe bar are kind of hidden on the side because of his small they are . i find the slection tool in the hair room to be alittle bit annoying when trying to grow dynamic hair groups . i most of the time end up growing hair on too many facets . the control points are too senative , they end up twisting the body in un-natrual forms . the rendering takes a very long , and the rendering shader doesent always save my settings . i end up transporting the animation to another program to render faster . some of the cloths i cant set them up to be childern to the body parts so they end up not being connected to anything . i 'm sure there more on my mind by i dont have much time to write up an review . just keep in mind 3d animation isnt perfectly easy . a good modeling programs to make obj files will go a long way .
1418,when i first installed the program i was able to access the images , but since that first time i haven't . my operating system is xp and i do n't know if that is the problem with the software . i have since then uninstalled it . i did not think this product was very easy to use
1419,it 's not a conflict of good and evil that drives millions ( fox ) , but rather issues of what 's right and wrong . set in the uk , this exquisite family film about two brothers , serious seven year old damien and fun-loving nine year anthony , who recently lost their mom and discover a suitcase full of british pounds has dropped out of the sky and crashed into their playhouse . and it 's only seven days before the official currency switches to euros . the brothers think it came from god and they have differing agendas : spend it on themselves or give it to the needy . but the money , on a train to incinerators , was tossed by crooks to accomplices and they want the missing bag back . millions is funny , scary and profound . you may even discover things about yourself you never before considered . rated : pg . genre : family drama / comedy . 1 hour , 38 minutes . starring : james nesbitt , daisy donovan , alex etel , lewis mcgibbon . director : danny boyle .
1420,review no.77.a superbly / nicely done reissue of the zombie 's second ' actual ' album ( is n't it ? ) .total of 27 tracks , so since the first twelve ( 12 ) cuts were the original lp , i guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks , wow ! that 's a lot , for a one-disc release.a fine cd to repeatedly play , plus keep in your ' current rotation ' stack for a long time to come.it 's probably just me , but these tunes should be in a different playing order.that 's why i 'll sometimes pre-program this cd before i listen to it.loads of fabulous / memorable tunes to enlighten your evening with here , like " care of cell 44 " ( three versions , but welcome ) , " time of the season " ( stereo and mono versions ) , the beautifully-done melodic " a rose for emily " ( 2 versions ) , " i want her , she wants me " , " maybe after he 's gone " and a cut that i 've certainly never heard before , but was quite impressed with it , " butchers tale " .obviously , the zombies must 've had hours of unreleased material that most of the world did n't take great notice of , until now.simply , a must-have.timeless top rate british invasion rock&roll that 'll never truly die
1421,my family goes swimming quiet a bit . i got the sports pack to take pictures of the kids underwater in the pool . this is a big hit . it works extremely well . i also highly recommend the sony dsc-t9 camera . it 's great for trips . it 's so small you can put it in your pocket and the pics look great
1422,bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting . easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights , with the crank , make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope , no matter how tall they are . compact and lite to carry , makes it easy to transport to and from the range
1423,drills are excellent , vocabulary has good variety.. . picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me , but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language .
1424,i own hallmark card studio 2006 , and this product is a different , interesting addition to greeting-card-making . it has lots of kinds of pictures , i.e. , aquatic mammals / fish , etc , for making " fun " children 's cards
1425,i have not gotten into watching the dvd as of yet because i am still watching the reruns on tv , but i know i have no qualms with the dvd . i have bought all the series thus far . it is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan
1426,...because it felt like it predicted that i 'd be listening to the cd someday . i 'm referring to the line " the kids of ad 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today . " now i admit that i was 18 in 2000 so i guess i technically missed the literal kid description by a year , but the more general prediction of the inter-generational , timeless appeal of the beatles was right on . i did n't see them on the ed sullivan show . i was born almost twelve years after they broke up , and about a year after the tragic shooting of john lennon . but i , like many , many other people born too late to have experienced beatlemania as it was occuring , have since become a huge fan of all their work . this album has my favorite of all the beatle 's songs : i 'll follow the sun . that song alone is worth the five stars , but thankfully the rest of the album is great too . this album gets a little bit too much grief , and it may not be quite as amazing as something like abbey road , but it 's still better than just about anything else out there .
1427,this is a great barber-style setup.. . it comes with a lot of guides and has a little case . they even give you a garbage bag . good dea
1428,i usually use adaware to scan my computer weekly , and like others , i would like to try the trial version spyware doctor to scan my computer . the result was , i had more than 200 infections ! i was amazed that my other virus scan programs did n't catch any of these infections , and my computer had been running properly . of coz , i would like to remove these infections and so i paid with my creditcard and got the license no . after entering the license no . and scanning , i continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught . before clickinig the remove button , i checked what i would delete and the files seems ok to be deleted . i had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections . i clicked yes to restart . from then , my nightmare began , i could n't start my computer at all ! ! ! not even displaying the loggin window ! my computer just kept restarting again and again . after 5 times restarting automatically , i smelled something burning from my computer ! ! ! i was so scared becoz there are some important files that i have n't backup yet ! endup , i reformat my computer ! ! ! i could n't login my old account again ! now , i have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have . luckily i was able to reinstall 70% of the softwares ( you gotta know the serial no . for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall , and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them , and not all of them ! ) some of my important files could n't be opened again because i do n't have the softwares to open them ! i was / am still so mad about this ! the spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that 's why i could n't restart my computer . yet , i reinstalled spyware doctor again because i paid and only used it once . however , i could n't use it after reinstalling like other softwares . even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no . that i purchased , it 's just simply not working ( the website said i do n't have to repurchase and it should work ! ) so i paid $10 , only used the spyware doctor once , but i lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $400
1429,now i try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum , like in tea . i do not drink coffee . so when i took stacker 3 ( just one pill ) i was jittery and could not fall asleep . i stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day . i felt nauseus too . now this was probably because i do n't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it , but i do n't recommend stacker 3 anyway
1430,let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch , at least when it comes to the horror genre . numerous people where i work told me that this movie , " the descent " was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made . in their defense , my co-workers were n't the only people with this opinion , many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing . well , apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to , because i was sorely disappointed , but more on that later , for now i will give you my plot summary for last year 's supposed horror spectacular , " the descent " " the descent " begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends , when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident . one year later at the prodding of those same friends , she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure , the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave , in fact it 's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet . so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave . making matters worse , this cave is not like any ordinary cave , for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal . at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story , and the shocking opener really caught my attention , giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected . however , once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave , which is actually where the majority of the film takes place , things begin to go awry for the picture . at first , the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere , giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom . then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie , this is a cave that no one has been in , and these girls are hardly professional . so , who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave . it 's absolutely stupid , especially when placed viewed in the context of the character 's interaction and companionship with each other , none of these girls would do this to each other . after this occurs the mutants show up , a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction ; however , this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster , because it 's now just one gory scene after another , and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie . a decision i somewhat agreed with , yet still did n't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown . on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls , you just assume they 're cannibalistic , but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there . even though " the descent " was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time , by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers , to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity . " the descent " is unrated and contains violence and language
1431,i was disappointed in this video . i came to it not as a devout catholic but as a fan of travel videos . in other words , i watched this video with the same motivation i would have to watch shackleton 's antarctic exploration , or something from the globe trekker series . with that in mind , the target audience for this video is not me . it is the religious catholic . therefore , from my perspective , i ca n't recommend it . i 'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion . i do n't enjoy worshipping the " holy father " , or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the swiss guard . if you are a devout catholic you will probably enjoy this video . if you are not , and just came to the video because you wanted a globe trekker style tour of the vatican , you are likely to be disappointed . and that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not
1432,mcmurry 's text is a very friendly , gentle intro to organic . it 's a thoroughly enjoyable read , but it does n't teach you what you need to know . explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief , and the problems included are usually very basic and general ( the spectroscopy and synthesis problems , in particular ) . if you 're looking to become a chemist , this is not the book to learn from . i 'd recommend vollhardt and schore 's textbook , or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully ( i.e. , on exams or out in the industry )
1433,why use 1 word when 12 will bewilder the reader and make the book that much thicker . i can not believe that a qualified editor reviewed this book . the wheat to chaff ratio is horrendous . you can go whole paragraphs without coming upon anything worth knowing . i can only hope that the actual cisa exam questions are not written as poorly as the sample questions within this book . if you value your time , do not buy this book
1434,rites of spring is an unparalleled work of cultural and historical synthesis , and easily the most interesting cultural history of 20th century europe available .
1435,great compact design . takes up very little room in your suitcase . rollers heat up & are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims . sets hair better then most rollers ( and i have tried many ) . the only thing that i would change , is to add 2-4 more rollers . but i liked these rollers so much , i actually bought a 2nd set & use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers i own !
1436,i used turbotax premier last year & was so happy with it that i told everyone to buy it this year . what a fool i was . this years program was a nightmare . i will never purchase it again . every time i needed to go back to check something , i had to go backwards through each page until i reached the page i wanted . then to go forward to where you originally were , you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time . it got to the point i quit going back to check . it took hours this year and i am still not confident the results were correct . i may take it to h&r block just to see if i need to file an amend . next year i will try a different product . - --one other thing , navigating the state portion was so difficult . there were hidden pages in something called " quick zoom " or some such thing . i could never figure out where i was . thanks for the headache turbotax
1437,i have been very satisfied with the monitor . it is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate . i was disappointed to find when i opened the box that there were no instructions included . a quick phone call had them on the way . i was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time , etc. all-in-all it is a quite satisfactory device
1438,i am just writing this review to correct alexander from russia , who cites this album as a christianity peddler . leonard cohen is a jew , who unlike bob dylan ( on john wesley harding ) embraces his sense of jewish heritage and religion within his music . alexander , you 've brought your own interpretation to what is a distinctly jewish artist and his work
1439,obviously bogus reviews . version 6 was slow as a dog , so any improvement will make this more interesting . of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting . what about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5 ? how bout tossing us all a bone
1440,fast delivery , great price . i would buy from them again , thanks =
1441,this book is as much about life as it is about baseball . the positive re-enforcement the book gives about accomplishing almost anything is the true message . whenever you or one of your players is struggling , go back to this book to refresh a slumping attitude
1442,a very effective internet security package ... we installed this on my girlfriend 's pc a few months ago and it 's done a super job in keeping her machine trouble free . two thumbs up . effective , easy to install and use and keep updated . a real winner .
1443,amazon is selling this at nearly 50% off ! the eyepieces are great for a beginner and the great case has room for more when you add them . the filters are really cool .
1444,have had an olympus 4.0m.for 4 years and been very happy with it . as a gift i got this canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness . shot about 600 pictures people were blurred , not crisp and dim even on a sunny day . had to return it.do n't bu
1445,these ' cartridges ' sell for about $2 a piece , plus shipping . i recently switched from the mach 3 turbo to a merkur double edge safety razor and i can safely say i will never go back . the mach 3 provides a decent enough shave ( much better than an electric , in my experience ) but the single blade is actually much smoother . i pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the mach 3 at $1.50- $2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days
1446,i use these almost every morning . they 're hot and ready to go in seconds . i like the nonslip surface of the curlers . makes it so easy to set my hair , remove , and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style . i like having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick , long hair . these rollers rock
1447,this was a great movie i really enjoyed it . the story was unique and the acting was great .i thought it was the best ghost story i have seen
1448,i purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference . the password manager is quite useless . in more than half the times it did not enter passwords . in cases where it entered passwords , it took about 5 seconds to do so . it also asked me if i want to store passwords repeatedly for the same site . it interfered with the operation . it did not let me go to sites like paypal and charles schwab . when i contacted symantec support , their response is to disable the phishing protection when i want to go to these sites . my quicken started having problems . i had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is confidential that is causing the problems . i would have given this s / w 0 stars if it is possible . now , i uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it . i ca n't believe that a company like symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable
1449,yes , i have to agree with the previous review . it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources . it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything . if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much , and just chalk it up to extra protection . but that seems to be all it 's good for
1450,as always the latest compilation in this annual science fiction anthology remains one of the great anthologies as the current entries are top rate . for the most part , the thirty contributions are superb tales from a who 's who of the genre . especially fascinating is paul mcauley 's creative entry " the two dicks , " in which philip k . dick writes mainstream fiction until he meets richard nixon . other stories are well written as gardner dozier scores again with selections that run the gamut from alternative realties to artificial intelligence to " animal " intelligence that worms its way into the reader 's mind . the introduction by mr. dozier provides a " summation " of the trends in the year , which can be summarized as " stable " . science fiction fans who appreciate shorts will devour this must reading that once again lives up to its title . harriet klausner
1451,first let me start off by saying this . ken sushi volume 1 is unquestionably the best video guide for making sushi . i have had a chance to see the other guides , and quite frankly they just do n't cut it . poor camera work , and even worse instruction should not be found in a sushi instructional video ( or any culinary instructional video for that matter ) . also , being taught by a sushi enthusiast rather than a professional sushi chef is not going to send a very good message to people who are really serious about learning how to make sushi properly ( people want to learn from someone experienced , not enthusiastic ) . finally we have a video that is taught by a professional in the sushi scene , and he really takes the time to lay out all the techniques he 's developed over the years , so that with a little practice ( and the benefit of not having to take the time ken did to trial and error his methods of perfect sushi creation ) i was actually able to make some really great sushi . the camera work is great ! no shakes or stutters , i did n't find myself distracted by the nuances of poor production quality . truthfully this video is done so well , you will just find yourself immersed in what ken is teaching ( it plays a lot like a chef martin yan instructional video ) . also it seems a lot of time was taken in pre production to really focus the instruction to a degree that it is thorough enough for someone familiar with sushi creation , yet developed enough so that someone completely new to the sushi experience can actually have a fair shot to making a wholesome , delicious dish . if you take the time to watch the video a few times , and practice along with it . you will make sushi good enough to eat , and present to your friends , family ( just utterly show off ) . i 'm just really glad i can finally say there is now a sushi instructional video that i feel was worth every penny of my purchase . if you want to really learn how to make sushi well , then ken sushi volume 1 will be your number one resource . the only negative thing i have to say is where the heck is volume two ? ? ? ?
1452,i had bought a tingler elsewhere for $20 , plus shipping , so when i saw this one advertised for $9 , i was a bit hesitant that it was n't the real tingler , but a cheap knock-off ( especially since they show no picture ) . but , i decided to risk it and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is not only the real tingler , it is also shipped in a pretty velvet pouch for wonderful gift-giving . amazon , of course , also offers free shipping for $25 or more , so i bought 3 and got them all shipped free ! great deal ! and , by the way , it is incredible ! it really did send little shivers down my spine the first few times i used it . while you sort of get used to the feeling after a while and the little shivers may disappear , it still feels fabulous on your head
1453,my husband is a wheelchair user and loved these , said it keeps his eyes warm while driving down the stree
1454,i cannot believe this is billed as a baby video . the images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value . i personally like the baby miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby .
1455,mindless jock rock masterminded by a dope fiend . this kind of crap could n't even sell a can of coke these days . choreographed crunches of noise as lame as a crackhead on crutches . i hear scott weiland kept a billy goat in his trailer during the making of this snoozer - - and that when recording was all done the goat was nowhere to be found , but scotty was sporting a fresh new goatie
1456,i was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd . i would not recommend anyone buying this dvd until the quality is back to that of a professional recording
1457,my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800. my intent was to put him in the shade . that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000. tried new batteries , tried bluffing , even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500 / 600 yards . my opinion is this product is not worth the postage . anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product . [...
1458,great product , the girls had a blast with it . real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair . great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled ! although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair . not all the time though . still a fabulous product . would highly recommend it . my niece wishes it came with more gems
1459,this frame looks great until you turn it on . the picture quality is less than stellar , but that is n't what annoyed me about this frame . when you buy this frame do n't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program . what does that mean you ask ? that means that your photos wo n't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode . you will have 2 black bars on either side of your images ; this will not take advantage of the entire frame . if you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame , making peoples faces distorted . i have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation . see below . the build quality of the frame is pretty good . if mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen , this would be a nice little frame . a little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio , but i figured it out . 16:9 stretches the image , making it look distorted . these steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal . i set up a macro in photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse . you will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image . some of your images might be better served one at a time . start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program . 1. go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% ( or 788 pixels ) this will make the image look distorted . that is ok . 2. then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% ( or 591 pixels ) the image is ready to save . you might want to save as in to another folder so you can go back to your original if needed . 3. copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame
1460,the camera is decent . the fact that it does n't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable . what do they expect 90% of consumers are going to do with it
1461,what else can be said about this great cd ? it 's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs . " child of vision " is the best ( the piano solo is killer ) of the best , but this is one of those rare cd 's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end ( no skipping over songs you do n't like ) . a true classic
1462,what a great little accessory for my camera . could have used it in seattle last month , boy did it rain
1463,i bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair , when it gets hot it would stop . good thing i did n't throw it away . this cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months . it is also very loud ! almost hurt my ears to use i
1464,this camera is amazing . out of the 3 digital camera 's under $150 i 've used , this is by far the best , beating out the kodak and the sipix . i originally bought the sipix , and it was junk . do n't buy the sipix that 's under $150. the kodak for some reason did n't seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix , but the software was a little better , being from kodak . this camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels , but i do n't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing . it comes with a 16mb removable memory card , so you can take around 49 pics at 1mp , around 24 at 2mp , and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution , or more on a lower setting . the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power , and the 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it has a nice , sleak design , and the software has no issues with windows xp at least . the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2x digital zoom , which is pretty much useless , and i never use it , since it 's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer . so you can consider it not having any zoom . the software for it works well , but it could be better , options wise . the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card , so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day ( since it creates folders based on date ) , you 'll have to rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since the pictures come out so incredibly well . i 'm so happy with this camera ! if you want a camera under $150 , this is the one to get . do n't even waste your time with the kodak , unless you want the one with 3x optical zoom , but that 's $200. i use it for general purpose , taking pictures of freinds and such . once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at 2mp , and that will be photo quality printed on a full page . 1mp creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images , and .3mp will created good smaller images to put on websites . there 's no reason to buy anything else , go with the fuji finepix a200 !
1465,first off , to the above comments , while i thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons , and would be interested to read other history lessons from you , you have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the 300 spartans at thermopolye , but of the graphic novel . now this is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense , but the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell itself . **** caution spoiler alert ***** besides that the soundtrack is amazing and it is always a joy to listen to a soundtrack that really captivates the real emotion of that particular scene , i especially enjoyed the music when they fight the " beasts " and it is really hard rock , and i especially loved the ending music when the entire spartan army is gathered and the one spartan is telling them to remember leonidas ( it is called remember us on the soundtrack ) . may we all find our own " glorius death
1466,it just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become . nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance : ashlee simpson , lindsay lohan , and now paris hilton ? lmao ! no seriously though , i 'm still totally not sure how paris hilton became so famous . yes , i know she 's the hilton hotel heiress , but i 'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention . all she did was live off her family fortune , but now thanks to that fortune , she was able to get the right contacts , to make her own record label called " heiress records " which is a sub-label of warner bros . after a reality show series , modeling career , a sex tape , and a couple of roles in a few movies , what did she think to herself ? i think i want to be a singer now ? apparently . and thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about . " stars are blind " is her first single off her debut album " paris " and let me tell you it 's nothing new or original . the song has kind of a ska beat , which i really do n't think much of . her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon , and the lyrics are mediocre . sorry paris , but you failed miserably as a musician . leave this profession for the people that really have the talent
1467,easy to use.it seems quite accurate.the only bad thing is it needs batteries , which cost a lot
1468,` ` people say again and again that philosophy does n't really progress ,  that we arestill occupied with the same philosophical problems as were thegreeks.but the people who say this don't  understand why ishas to be so. it is becauseour language has remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions. as longas there continues to be a verb ' to be'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as ' to eat ' and ' to drink ' , as long as we stillhavethe adjectives ' identical ' , ' true ' , ' false ' ,  ' possible ' , as long as we continueto talk of a river of time , of an expanseof space , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up.and what's more , this satisfies a longing for the transcendent , because , insofar as peoplethinkthey can see ` the limits of human understanding ' ,  theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these . ` ` ' ' philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language ` ` ` ` ambition is the death of thought'''  these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago ( but most people have yet to find this out ) .dennett , though he has been a philosopher for some40 years , is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist , john searle , studied under famous wittgensteinians ( searle with john austin , dennett with gilbert ryle ) but searle got the point and dennett did not . dennett is a hard determinist ( though he trys to sneak reality in the back door ) , and perhaps this is due to ryle , whose famous book ' the concept of mind ' ( 1949 ) continues to be reprinted . that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine . dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein , ryle ( andmany others since ) have exposed in detail . byaccident , just before this book , i had read ' 'the minds i' ' , which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad mistakes ( see my review ) , and saddest of all , they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess- --nagel's  ` what is like to be a bat ? ` and an early version of john searle's  chinese room argument explaining why computers do n't think. nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat 's mind would be like. searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does ( eg , it can translate chinese without understanding it ) . likewise , we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad- -or just intelligible- - for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our use of the words consciousness , choice , freedom , intention , particle ,  thinking ,  determines , wave , cause , happened , event ( and so on endlessly )  are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy ( and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved )  chaos reigns. wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this . unfortunately , he died inhis prime , his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind ( language ) worksand he never wroteany popular books , so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few . searle is one of the world 's leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books , some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennett's work.his review ` ` consciousness explained away' ' of dennetts 1991 book ` ' consciousness explained''  and his book ''the mystery of consciousness' ' are very well known , and show , in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing , why neither dennett ( nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic ) havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem- -ie , how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things , but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is ( mostly ) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious , thinks , etc , . he just points out that we do n't have any idea how this happens . searle characterizes as ' 'intellectualpathology' ' , the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book , where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how !  unsurprisingly , there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever , many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. like most people , it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world . they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30 's , and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. dennett says ( p98 ) that his view is compatibilism , ie , that free will ( whichi hopewe can equate with choice ) is compatible with determinism ( ie , that ''there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future'' --p25 ) . he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however , the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice , in the sense we normally understand it , disappears and we are left with ` ` choice ` ` , which is something we cannot choose. naturally , this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ` ` consciousness explained ` ` . it is remarkable that , at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works ( or how an atom works for that matter ) , that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote : ' ' and what's more , this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent , because , insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see ` the limits of human understanding ' , theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these . ` ` the relation between language ,  thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very , very careful , some understanding is possible , but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. there are at least 3 different topics here ( evolution of our brain , choice and morality ) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms. there is , however , no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms ( or his favorite example , the game of life running on a computer ) are isomorphic with reality. he knows that quantum indeterminacy ( or the uncertainty principle ) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined ( and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom ) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with. by extension ,  its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain , so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain ( whatever that may be ) . however , the universe is a big place and its been around a long time ( perhaps forever ) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state. the notion ' 'there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future' ' cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur- -in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics- -each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes . he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice . this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness ( or any other emergent phenomenon ) . if so , they will definitely win at least one nobel prize , for not only will they have explained consciousness , they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence ( how higher order properties emerge from lower ones ) . so , they would have to solve the ' easy ' problem ( to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty ) and the ' hard ' one ( what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc ? ) . and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible- -an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain . it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable , even for one atom or a vacuum , as it would require an infinite amount of computer time . but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer . he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls , but physics is made of notions just as fantastic ( uncertainty ,  entanglement , wave / particle duality , schrodinger 's dead / alivecat etc ) and as feynmann said many times ` ` nobody understandsphysics ! ' ' many think nobody ever will . on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our ' 'robotic teams are put togther , over a lifetime of growth and experience . ` `  this is a bald dismissal of human nature , of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood , and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism . on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference , but for whom ?  nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what 's the problem ?  one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem. what are consciousness ,  pain ,  yellow , intention , matter , quarks , gravity etc. ?  i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice. this shows that there is something strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different. there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc , and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit thinking about the past , planning for the future ,  guessing the mental states of others , etc , but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think ` ' john will try to steal my wallet' ' , rather than just imagining that john might do it , confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode , enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way- -they lose control of which mode they are in , eg , notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have . one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode. normal mode- -eg , what is that lion doing- - was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes- -what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next- -evolved later. this was probably never a problem for animals- -any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically , could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes. hence , we have philosophy and this book , which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode . ' let us alter wittgenstein 's quote to read : ' 'as longas there continues to be a verb ' to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as ' to eat ' and ' to drink ' , as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action , of saying i wish i had done otherwise , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up. ' ' as withmost philosophy books , nearly every page ,  often every paragraph , changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc , and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world. on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives , like we count on food and water , but who ever , outside philosophy , standing in front of lunch counter full of food , ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water ?  even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode , i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice. wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones ( this is not a trivial observation ! ) . the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say that normally , nobody counts on having choice ,  but rather we just choose. on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics. he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice ,  and that ` ' it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct , as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic , but it is not . ' ' and on page 13- - ''it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs'' . the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning , deciding , promising ,  resenting ,  etc , but that these are built-in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood. there is no evidence that they change as we grow , or are in any way subject to our beliefs , only that they mature just as our body does. on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it ! do we believe we see an apple , feel a pain , are happy ?  the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing. we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we ca n't meaningfully then say that we still believe it ( except as a joke etc. ) . the inference engine can run in decoupled ( belief )  mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them , but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is saying thisis the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else- -consciousness ,  seeing , thinking , etc. if we take this seriously ( and he says ' the serious problems of free will ' ) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life , then madness is minutes away . . on page 65 et seq . , he discusses causation , intention and the ` informal predicates ' that we use to describe atoms etc , but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents ( ie animals or people or things like them- -ie , ghosts or gods ) are involved we use our concepts ( engines ) for agency , intuitive psychology , social minds , etc to decide how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines , depending on the precise situation . discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics ,  agency , ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein 's many incisive comments on causation , intention , deciding , nor of searle 's now classic works on intention and social reality . he spends much time on ainslie 's book ' breakdown of will ' , in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties ( ie , inference engines ) by which we evaluate probable outcomes . hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism , emotion and economics , but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published . it was bingham 's idea , amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson ( 1992 ) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising. indeed they are , and in fact they are standard parts of economic , evolutionary and cognitive theory , but unfortunately ,  he makes little reference to the other work in these fields . all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them . he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will , and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities . but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters !  dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text. again , he gets things backwards , as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self , but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines. as he notes , hundreds of experiments with the prisoner 's dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people 's choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious , they are much slower and less reliable . so , there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought . dennett says ` we make ourselves ' so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite. our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results. if we or others do not we feel guilt , outrage , resentment etc ,  then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we ca n't ( mostly ) do otherwise , not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it . we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50 , 000 and some millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world . on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as ' 'a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making ( from certain angles ) ' ' . he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some ( unspecified )  properties possessed by traditional free will. the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. he insists ( top pg 226 ) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility , but making ourselves so we could n't do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function ,  nor does it seem to leave any room for morality , as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise . he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so. normally if someone asks us to move our hand , we know what counts as having a choice ,  but , typical of philosophers ,  i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position . at this point he also starts his discussion of libet 's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time . on page 253 et seq . , he sneaks in his definition of conscious will- -the ' 'brains user illusion of itself'' ' which has as one of its main roles providing ' 'me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times ` ` . and ` ` illusory or not , conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action . ` `  he says the trick we need is to see that ` ` i ` '  control what is happening inside the ' 'simplification barrier'' ... ' 'where decision making happens'' . ` ` mental events' ' become conscious by ' 'entering into memory'' . ' 'the process of self description... is what we are'' . the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space ( the brain ) and time ( memories ) . he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous ( everyone who can follow this and really understands ! ) . ' 'i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors ,  some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness , and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced . ''  many will say he took the words out of their mouth , but i would say it 's incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe ( making the obvious extensions of such claims ) was gone long beforewegot this far. on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals ! this is a stunning denial of human nature ( ie , genetics and evolution ) coming from the person who wrote ' darwin 's dangerous idea' ' ! presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space ( the brain and other people ) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness ( line 6 from bottom ) . he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain ( you will have to suffer through ' consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either ) . though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology , he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades ( social mind , intuitive psychology , coalitional intuitions etc ) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts . if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture , thats ok , but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes . we are also told here that r&d ( by which he means evolution here , but other things elsewhere ) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality . i am sure that he will get little agreement on this . it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates ( and earlier ) long before spoken language ( though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain ) . he continues ` ` morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago ` ` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake ! and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes , which is an amazing ( and totally incorrect ) thing to say , even if he was only referring to memes . on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our ' 'bland dispositions to cooperate' ' ,  they mean nothing to us , but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us. there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being ( eg , autism ) . i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think . he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them . this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology . i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions , like all the templates , are accessible to consciousness . we may decide our cheating was justifiable , or forgive someone else 's cheating , but we still know it was cheating ( ie , we cannot change the engine ) . i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings . another issue is that as culture developed , one had to make many important or ' moral type ` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer . on pg 267 he says that we now replace our ` free floating rationales ' ( probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines ) with reflection and mutual persuasion . and on pg 286 he says that it is a child 's upbringing - -demanding and giving reasons- - that affects moral reasoning . again , he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research- -the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing . we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self , which takes responsibility . it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition . on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education ( memory ) and sharing . it 's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments . on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between ' ought'and ' is ' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago- -ie , they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people . he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes ( eg see ' the blank slate ' ) . he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology , but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion . this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like ' praiseworthy ' were shaped over millennia by culture , while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms . on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess ( evolutionarily stable strategy ) can produce morality . his idea here is that genetic ` r&d ` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture ( memetics ) produces variations and clarifications . i would say that we all know , and much research has made clear , that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases . culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings . the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore , which i started reading 30 years ago since it 's authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein. dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us. but , there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book . there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy - and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book- -another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho 's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy . one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here , nor in anything he has done , that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them . it seems clear that , like all of us , he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines . so , how much opportunity is there to improve our morality ?  it seems clear ( eg , see pinker 's ` the blank slate ` ) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment , in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties . on average , maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior ( variations are the only thing we can study ) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect . how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is . and if one did , we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc. but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking , coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is ! and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first . to return to the quote at the beginning- - 'ambition is the death of thought' . indeed- -though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts
1469,this is a very good camcorder with the main problem i noted being the dvd format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in hd mode per disk . it is also a problem that only blue-ray dvd players can play back the dvd in hd mode . even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player . nevertheless , the price was good and i think blue-ray will be more affordable in the near future . meanwhile , i can playback my video directly or send it to the computer . i am glad i bought it . if a minidv tape version were available at the same price now i think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though . i was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but sony sent a new one right away . be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it . overall - i am very happy with the camcorder
1470,i was n't sure what to expect when i 1st tried this two-part microdermabrasion & peel kit . i use it twice a week , and what a difference it has made on my skin . the only thing is , i wish they made a bigger bottle of the peel . mariann
1471,hollywood make them , then they break them - - stars can fall as fast as they rise . sometimes they rise again , and sometimes they disappear . and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in " the big picture , " a quirky , cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of . it has a few awkward stretches , but overall it 's a darkly witty cult comedy ( " you 're tracking failure all over my carpet ! " ) . nick chapman ( kevin bacon ) is the winner at an arty student movie competition , and instantly agents are chasing him all over l.a. in no time , he 's the rising young director , with a movie deal at a major movie corporation . but he 's also starting to lose sight of his old life , as he tries to become a major success . he changes the style , plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics , turning it into a beach bums / naked ghost movie . he dumps his pretty girlfriend ( emily longstreth ) for a bimbo actress ( teri hatcher ) . when the studio head gets dropped , nick falls as quickly as he rose . but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance - - an arty music video . this time , can he get it right ? christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries , tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals . his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz . but his talents are just as present in a " typical " movie , and guest does a smart , quirky job of it . the lesson : be true to yourself and your art , do n't fall for empty glitz , and do n't let success go to your head if you 're lucky enough to get it . the story is a pretty straightforward one - - nick gets great success , it goes to his head , he falls , and he rises again a wiser man . and the movie falls into straightforward lines , without many unpredictable plot twists . at first glance , it does n't seem that unusual . what makes it special ? well , simply put , guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit , like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick 's life . not to mention the glorious dialogue . when speaking of nick 's one'n'only music video , a studio woman announces , " it 's the best one yet , and i 've seen ' em all ! " and guest manages to show us agents , artists , students , directors and actors , but never descended to cliches . they 're real people , no matter how nasty . and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is . his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet , where he confesses , " i wanna be your friend again . " and he 's backed by good performances by longstreth , michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh . " big picture " treads where many movies have gone before , but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video . a must-see
1472,this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this . it adds virtually nothing to xp . too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition . that would have been worth the money , but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product . the themes are nice but far too few for the price . the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things . the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring . hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff . too bad could have been something but in its present form , not worth the money
1473,i bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where i was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that i could get a reality check on my activity levels . i opened the box , read the easy directions , set up my personal step measurement ( just measure off the distance of your 10 steps ) , and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day . i was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me ! over the next 6 days , ( this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you ) ; i literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with no aerobic exercise on day 1 , to 7 , 880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3 ! every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10 , 000 " normal " steps , and increasing the aerobic steps too ( which are tracked separately ) . i can press the mode button , check out how many miles my steps translate to , kilocalories burned , aerobic steps , and compare it with the past 7 days as well . it has turned out to be even more fun than what i originally bought it for . i actually feel better , and the fun part is that i am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day ! this has been an eye-opening experience for me , and i keep this on or in my pocket all the time now , just to make sure i keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day
1474,i bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option . it was not easy to use , as you have to put in your information unless you want to use kilograms , and you still have to enter your height in meters . all that aside , it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15%. am i an athlete ? no . am i female ? yes . is 14% body fat possible ? ? ? well let 's just say it is highly unlikely . i ca n't comment on the water numbers it gives me because i do n't really have anything to go on there , but even at my fittest i was over 20% body fat , and that was a while ago. .
1475,this is a film like none other you have ever seen , and as such you 'll either love it , or hate it . from the " reviews " posted on amazon , i 've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who do n't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it . this film is not literal . learn to *think* about what you are watching . to interpret archetypes , symbolism and metaphor . a clue : the lady character is named story . now why might that be ? and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world ? and what precisely does the wolf-like scrunt represent ? and why are there three of those monkeys ? this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world . if you are n't an artist , you probably wo n't get it at all , and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this . but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says , and love every beautiful , unique and visionary second of it . magical .
1476,i have gotten better results with sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price...like less the $15 shipped
1477,i really enjoyed this dvd . the instructor is very charismatic , unlike most instructional videos . he really knows his stuff . the only reason i would n't give it 5 stars is because i do n't believe that any dvd or video can really train a person to play an instrument . it comes from personal experience , not formula
1478,the camera is a superb , light-weight wonder . the controls are logical and the large display area is amazing . i love it .
1479,rather a funny novel , gets off to a slow start but the end is superb . worth reading
1480,the wifi is a great idea ! the idea on paper sounds amazing , but the way you had to do it was horrible . it gave you no control over what pictures or anything . plus it was slow . the picture quality was horrilbe ! ! ! m y two megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera . they look amazing on the lcd screen , but once you get them on the computer , they are fuzzy , grainy , etc. i would not recomend this camera to anybody . yes , it has some nice features , but the pictures are anything but acceptable
1481,it 's a piece of junk , so save your money and some headaches . even dell technicians ca n't fix it . my new dell computer had norton ghost pre-installed with a back-up hard drive just for cloning . it sounded like a perfect setup except my norton ghost would n't work . contacted dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with norton to no avail . now i 'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me
1482,it is over a hundred dollars but put it off this is the book . you wo n't need any others
1483,i can tell you first hand how amazon makes easy money . i am a formal seller here at amazon . not a big seller , but an honest one with a 5 star rating and zero claims.however amazon allows dishonest buyer 's to do chargebacks months after a purchase and then has nothing in place to assist seller 's in getting their merchandise back . sounds like retail fraud to me ! ! i wish there was a lower rating to give to this website.they are truly at the bottom !
1484,the film seems to focus on 70 's punk exclusively . anything post-1980 is glossed over , clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this " documentary " . i think the film does well documenting the roots of punk , seeing as how letts was steeped in the scene at that time ( although the misfits were n't mentioned , which i found odd ) . the interviews with henry rollins and jello biafra were great as well . however , in order to claim to be a documentary , the evolution of punk rock is just as integral ( perhaps more so ) as its origins . i think , basically , letts based the film on his own opinions , likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk . i was disapointed .
1485,i got this camera for my birthday present in january and i 'm extremely satisfied . i 'm very new to the entire " photography world " , however this camera makes it easy to get into . the camera is smaller than i expected , however it takes great pictures . i use it often for pictures while we are on trips . the picture quality is great , however screen quality is n't up-to-par with other brands . this is a great value and i really like it . my only complaint is that the easyshare software is bad . it 's slow , outdated , and does n't work well overall . i recommend getting a 1 gb sd card . i have 3 of them
1486,while this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses , i cannot recommend it to other readers . the author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical christianity . she battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel . indeed , in reading some of the chapters , it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a christian worldview that might veer in any part from republican platform positions . this is really too bad , because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions . i would not have begrudged her political point of view at all , had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position
1487,i covered a similar theme in my international relations ma - whilst any programme made for tv has to be reasonable breif on the subject , i found this to be a very well argued and produced programme . i recomend it , not so much as some dark conspiracy , but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country . we should question to make sure that what happens in our name , is always in our interest
1488,turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040a to file , but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region . not only that , but if you have complications with trying to file , good luck . it looks as though i will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed . ttax is worthless
1489,i have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the kids channels . i was hoping the dvd would show each of his songs as they are performed on tv . instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons . this would have been a better cd instead of a dv
1490,try to call panasonic customer service @1-800-973-4264 and tell them you have question about your camcorder first . panasonic service is the worst one in this world .
1491,this dvd teaches the history of tai chi , and the history of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form . it explains that these two tai chi forms were originally a martial art style , and that now they are usually done for health improvement . then it shows the 24 posture form from the front , and the back , and with breathing instructions . im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements , but when i am , this is a great guide . it then shows each of the 24 postures , and their original martial art applications , which helps you have a strong intent during the posture , and keeps your arms and legs in proper position . then , it teaches the 24 posture form , step by step , with very detailed instruction . this is a much more expanded version of this video by master liang than the original vhs . the dvd also shows the 48 posture form , which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form , and has other movements from other styles . it has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average . it has also improved my confidence , and people keep saying i have a glow about me . i just feel healthier , and happier too . this dvd is easy to learn from quickly . the chinese bamboo flute music is nice . oh , actually , my favorite part is at the end , it shows a ' slideshow ' of photos of the master , doing each posture move-by-move , with great music . i like to do my form along to this section , because it is a bit slower than the actual form , and you can exactly match your movements to the master . its like having a one-on-one class with him . i find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly . i remember the form now , without having to ' think ' , so i can try to turn my attention inward . a great dvd
1492,mine is dry sensitive skin and the cream works well . i like the way this cream gives instant glow
1493,i expected more african vocals in it. . thats the main reason i brought the cd , i recently became a fan of that kind of music. . it had like 3 songs on there that i liked , besides that this album is garbag
1494,a friend who knows my taste in music recommended vnv nation to me , so i got matter + form based on the reviews . in one sense i like it . the production is excellent and i find every track to be creative and unique . but i hate the vocals and so i ca n't bear to listen to the cd . this dude has the worst voice in music history .
1495,this product works great , they recharge fast , are just warm to the touch not hot , and have extremely long battery life . battery charger works great and has nice car charger adapter
1496,it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele . the fusion is a classic example , from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel . do n't buy into the hype , the fusion is an expensive joke of a product .
1497,the upgrade is $75 cheaper and you do n't need to have a previous install of windows to get it to work . simply do the following : 1. boot with the windows vista upgrade dvd . 2. click " install now . " 3. do not enter a product key when prompted . 4. when prompted , select the vista product edition that you do have . 6. install vista normally . 7. once the install is complete , restart the dvd-based setup from within windows vista . perform an in-place upgrade . 8. enter your product key when prompted . this is according to microsoft 's internal documentation , and reported by paul thurrott at windows it pro
1498,i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one-sided book i 've ever read . it was n't about the crimes , it was about this author 's personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos . he has a real problem with women , lesbians in particular . he made ms. wuornos out to be someone she wasn't . she had a hard life , yes and chose to committ crimes , but that was n't what this book was about . again , it was n't worth the $. i actually threw my copy of this away
1499,ivalooshun is skary . i red the bibel . the bibel saez ivalooshun is bad . ivalooshun shud go away . i red wer sumwun saed the werld goez arund the sun but that is a lie . luk in the ski and yu can see the sun goe arund the werld . monsters is skary to . monsters shud goe away
1500,i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas , and he is absolutely in love with them . the distance it can handle is slightly above average , but the clarity is really where this thing shines . its very easy to use , and has held up reasonably well . i would recomend it to the casual user
1501,i discovered this in an airport bookshop and it is a great read on a flight . i takes some of the most insightful trend study and boils it down so that anybody can get their arms around why design is the most important factor in your business today . yes any bussiness . this is my hyperbole tom is much better at stating the case . but when a management guru like tom puts out a visualy interesting as well as well thought out book like this it is time to take notice . read and use or be left in the dust
1502,love this product . i like having these microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios
1503,i 've been doing game dev for a number of years now , and it 's like a breath of fresh air to come upon a book like this . clearly written , well organized , and a breeze to read through ! my thanks goes out to each and every one of the authors who contributed to this invaluable tome . i 'd give this thing six stars if i could . you will not regret buying this book ! !
1504,ok , booty rap was good in the 90 's , when it was offensive and raunchy like , 2 live crew , disco rick and the dogs , poison clan etc.....but this is just wack weak lyrics , corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same....and is it just me are these guys as rappers , just horrible there voices all raspy , and annoying and one the guy 's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr.... . ( what is he on crack or something ) so if you like radio friendly , pretty boy music then the ying yang twins are for you peace.. .
1505,the best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty of antioxidants , and contains a good amount of protein . the only down side is the high amount of carbs , especially the sugars , but i still give it five stars
1506,this , in my very humble opinion , is the most useful , the sharpest , and just about anything else good you can think of say , best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast and that 's what you want when the light is low . my gal pal sara and i have often wandered the caribbean islands in the dawn 's early light , as she is into shooting old homes . she particularly likes the gingerbread homes in marigot , on the french side of st. martin . i swear she must have them all on her hard drive . it 's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light . she just loves it and since i love her , i gotta love it too . seriously though , i 've used the lense quite a bit myself and it 's a keeper if ever there was one . you just go wrong with a canon " l " lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home from the se
1507,i suppose one of the great attributes of the internet is that it allows the juxtaposition of the good , the bad and the ugly . where else could one find reviews of one of the twentieth century 's towering works that variously describe it as a recipe for a police state , an incitement to theft , or as written by someone with no understanding of philosophy ( my personal favourite - thanks adrian !
1508,complete waste of money . i purchased my copy at wal-mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake i did . the graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful . the actaul program is so not like that . the graphics are down right cheesy , and low budget . having only paid $9 for this program , i feel like i was completely ripped off . i 'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund . 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item
1509,i picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities that are essential to good teaching and effective learning . unfortunately , i discovered on reading it that the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific & quot ; establishment&quot ; with credulity for numerous fringe ideas . the first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell when you 'll be home for dinner ! sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as & quot ; evidence&quot ; . the & quot ; do it yourself&quot ; promise of the title is broken for the reader who does n't intend to begin raising homing pidgeons or does n't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants ( such as the speed of light ) to nine significant figures . far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic research are given ( in chapters about the feeling of being stared at , or & quot ; feeling&quot ; the touch of a severed limb ) . despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book , i liked a part of its message , that important science can still be done by amateurs . that 's about the only aspect of this book that is commendable
1510,an outstanding compilation of a wide variety of popular and regional styles from across mexico . this set examines both traditional and contemporary music , including a brilliant ska-banda mix by the popular & quot ; rock en espanol&quot ; band , cafe tacuba . rancheras , corridos , boleros , indie rock and various stylistic fusions are represented , and even a few sones from veracruz - - one of my favorite musical genres ! if you are curious about the rich musical heritage of this large but often slighted nation , then check this collection out.. . it might open more than a few new musical doors
1511,this screensaver is terrible . it pauses and jerks around . very annoying . i emailed the company and never heard from them . i dont use it and i dont recommend it to anybody . thank yo
1512,i have read baldacci 's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them . this one , however , is just awful . not only the character 's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie . the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this : there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows , with lame lines like " the gun was loaded , and so was i " . that is exactly what this book is like , except it goes on for 400 pages . there is n't a single interesting character in this book , in my opinion . you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end . it 's the bataan death march of novels . i hope this is an aberration - i 'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good . but one more stinker like this one and i 'll drop his name from my reading list
1513,yes . wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes . are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot ? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story . recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film . candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast ( from oscar nominee matt dillon , kevin bacon etc ) can turn candy into cuisine
1514,in this cynical day and age , it 's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant ( not to mention amazing ) , but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage ? this film works as a eulogy to arthur " killer " kane , a synopsis of the dolls ' early years , and a buoy for rock ' n ' rollers lost at sea . it 's all things to all people , but it 's never boring or condescending . i would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema , whether they had any knowledge of the dolls or not , simply because it 's a great story , well told , and stands up to repeated viewings .
1515,director : denzel washington cast : denzel washington , derek luke , joy bryant , salli richardson , malcolm david kelley , cody hodges , leonard earl howze , novella nelson . running time : 120 minutes rated pg-13 for violence , language and mature thematic material involving child abuse . based on a true story , and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book , " antwone fisher " is at heart a study of psychological disturbance , laced with reasonable amounts of hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit . it 's a peculiarly american medicine , swallowed less willingly in some markets than others , which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused denzel washington 's directorial talents ( which are generally good ) with the various workings of his film 's plot , which can be argued about . antwone fisher 's story starts in the navy , where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate , and is hauled up before the captain . sent to navy psychiatrist jerome davenport ( washington ) , he begins to work out issues of anger that , it turns out , stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend . at the same time fisher ( played exceptionally well by newcomer derek luke ) , struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting cheryl ( joy bryant ) . in a parallel plot thread , washington 's character , the ever-reasonable dr. davenport , is having marital problems . in due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and fisher is a catalyst for his own change . fisher 's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route : after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience , he was hired by a sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable . most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft , although washington 's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks . the most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character . these include the psychiatrist 's ironic domestic problems , as well as fisher 's tentative love life . one is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements , leavening the appeal of a central , harrowing , personal history . the fisher - cheryl romance for instance , while in context necessarily clumsy , is also ultimately gauche . and once consummated , it is left to languish without further comment , as if further exploration of this side to fisher 's maturing was unnecessary . perhaps sensing this central weakness , fisher 's script introduces another element into the young african-american 's tortured life as a foster child . during flashbacks he has to deal with ' slave-nation ' justifications from mrs. tate ( novella nelson ) , suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting . significantly , such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself , and soon disappear from view . on the plus side is the central performance by derek luke as the hero , a perfectly judged acting job , that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - " i do n't know what to do " - with lack of self-pity . washington 's role is also well done . given the difficulty of the actor-director role , he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss , either in front or behind the camera . this is washington 's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing , it 's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods . arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role . despite its flaws , " antwone fisher " is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged , enigmatic individual ; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children did n't have to endure such horrors .
1516,i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the " old edition " , but judging by " look inside this book " , this new english-language edition incorporates much material from the old . incidentally , the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware , apparently his taken orthodox name , while timothy ware is his original , given name . in sweden , the swedish translation of " the orthodox church " is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church . apparently , its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history . it also contains chapters on theology and worship . in my opinion , the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history . its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire , under islam , and in russia both before and during communism . of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic-orthodox split , usually dated to 1054. the author believes that the so-called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split . however , the book must also be read with some reservations . the author is , after all , an orthodox christian himself . its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there . for instance , ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist , a very untenable suggestion . at other times , he is surprisingly " liberal " for an orthodox . for instance , he paints mehmet fatih , the muslim conqueror of constantinople , as a very tolerant ruler . i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian . even so , " the orthodox church " remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable christian church .
1517,i carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back , and as a result get a lot of headaches . i have been using the real-ease for about two months , and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches . i have not used it as a preventative - only when i already have a headache . if something happened to the one i have , i would definitely buy another
1518,i played several samples of this cd on my computer while visiting the amazon website and my male cat started meowing along . this cd is good for calming a cat and lining his box . face it , yoko ca n't sing ( unless you have a cat 's ears . )
1519,i purchased the revlon facial steamer , this was my first purchase on line and i am very satisfied with the steamer and the service i received from amazon . the steamer is great i use it when i give myself a facial , i have not use the nail kit yet .
1520,i did n't know why i chose to read this book . anyway , it was disappointing , really . the book was slow , and it was too long for a story of its type . i mean , i think the book could go on without some of the parts . when i was reading it , i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy . i thought the plot was shallow , but taylor 's self-conflict was even shallower . he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward . if you do n't believe me , go on and read about it.. . although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end . and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise . he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish . it really sucked . and yes , i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel.. . but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book . and what did i find ? nothing . oh , what a waste . it 's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader , it did n't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like . if it had n't been for my hrr ( home reading report ) i would n't have finished reading this at all . i guess i 'm saying this because i 'm not into this genre . love stories are fine but this one.. . nah
1521,every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to . the snapstream remote is one of them . i just recently built a home theater pc through which i play music and movies . however , the htpc is in a different room than my projector and i needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room . i chose the snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased . i also highly recommend the snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the beyond tv pvr solution . i record all my favorite tv programs on my htpc in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the snapstream remote . this is one product that i can recommend with no reservations
1522,having tried most all energy drinks , i can honestly say this one is different . guru picks me up gradually yet does not drop me down as though my wings have been clipped . one at noon and i 'm good to go for the rest of the day . plus , i do n't go home and kick the dog ! the taste is not sugary and at about $1.40 a can ( free shipping ) the price speaks for itself
1523,this album has some of the best country songs in the business . mark sings songs straight from his heart . there are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like & quot ; too cold at home&quot ; , & quot ; i 'll think of something else&quot ; , and & quot ; almost goodbye&quot ; to the fast , heels kicking & quot ; bubba shot the jukebox&quot ; , and & quot ; going through the big ' d' &quot ; . these songs are about real life realtionships and how they affect the heart . so if you 're in the mood to cry about that lost love or smile now that they 're gone this is the album for you
1524,while the dubbing may be a little annoying , i still love this movie . the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times . driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book . do n't expect the deepest movie in the world , but do expect a quality martial arts film
1525,as a librarian and a lover of all things relating to arts & crafts style , i recommend this book to anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture 's history and design evolution . with clear color photographs and just the right amount of text , this book illustrates the origins of arts & crafts furniture in england and its progression , first to our east coast , and eventually westward across america . in fact , my only ' complaint ' about this book is that the photographs are good enough that they leave you wanting for more . because of the depth of information presented here , i would not say that this is a general interest read - rather this book is geared toward those seriously interested in the history of the arts & crafts movement and its recent revival .
1526,i could not get the right code numbers to work with my new tv / dvd set.....too bad , i liked the large numbers and light .
1527,great cd . imus in the morning recommended highly and the i-man was not wrong . one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years . i listen to a lot of buffett , james taylor , delbert mcclinton , and this cd places high in these ranks
1528,mostly bland , by this time it seemed that bad was dead in the water , nothing here matches the excitement of this is . especially annoying are ` sightsee mc ! ' , ` ice cool killer ' and ` the big v' . bad goes rap ? no thanks . it 's easy to see why they did the whole bad 2 thing . buy the globe instead
1529,this is great-my daughter looks for reasons to use and wear the quick gems
1530,my first favorite television series was " twelve o'clock high " and i had at least two models of the " memphis belle " when i was kid , all of which simply reflects the fact that the b-17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane . when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b-17 parked out on somebody 's front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it . a couple of decades later one of the few b-17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one ( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought ) . for all i know that particular b-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film " memphis belle . " when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis , of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the " memphis belle " was on display ( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton , ohio this october ) . the " memphis belle " ( serial no . 41-24485 ) was one of 12 , 750 b-17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company , but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler 's europe without losing a crew member . the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down . the " belle " flew from november 7 , 1942 to may 17 , 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton-jones ( " scandal " ) from the script by monte merrick ( " staying together " ) . that simply means that besides the fact that the " memphis belle " was named for a lady friend ( margaret polk ) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same ( designed by the famous artist george petty ) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission , which was over lorient , france and not bremen , germany ( the " belle " flew there on its 21st mission ) . the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane 's mascot , a scotty dog named " stuka . " so if you want something closer to the " true " story of the pilot robert morgan and the " memphis belle " you want to check out william wyler 's 1944 documentary " the memphis belle : a story of a flying fortress . " what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes . then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis . so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot , eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator , tate donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home , d.b. sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up , billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight , sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret , reed edward diamond as the flight engineer , courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners , and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner . back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the " belle . " of course , it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the " memphis belle " is remembered for completing that final mission , so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run ( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the " belle " and they changed the name of the aircraft as well ) . but even if the " belle " survives there are other several b-17 crews on the mission who will not . still , the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated , allowing modine 's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage . but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan 's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else 's job .
1531,some of patterson 's conclusions were a bit of a reach . some of his segways were n't all that smooth . but this book is just plain entertaining . it is chopped full of stories on rockstars making deals with the devil , lingering around after death , and backed up with just enough innuendo-ish research for it to almost be believable . well , some of it actually believable . patterson scribes on about various rockstar-occult alliances ( in particular the rolling stones and led zeppelin ) and uses quotes from the musicians themselves .
1532,i did n't enjoy the film . i also did n't enjoy the original play by shakespeare . king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays . i do n't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done , and to add nothing of value to the original . you can set it wherever you like , in medieval japan or on the moon , what 's the difference . it 's king lear , a downer of a play , there 's nothing great about ran just as there 's nothing great about lear , and it takes up three hours of your time . a moron named lear , or hidetoro , or whatever his name is , relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son . the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father . he is right , of course , and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily . he 's wanted dead or dead . in this treatment of the annoying plot , he loses his mind . he has a faithful follower or two . they overact . there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play . lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk . am i supposed to care what happens to him ? why ? because he used to be a powerful king , and a cruel one ? you may as well cry over saddam hussein . look at this movie with fresh eyes . look at shakespeare 's king lear with fresh eyes . this stuff simply is not very entertaining , and is not very good . the hell with king lear . he 's an annoyance
1533,reviewer alianore 's opinion " rather too indulgent of its subject " is a very accurate portrayal of weir 's work . i will try to add something to that near perfect review . ( note : i listened to the unabridged audiobook of " queen isabella " , 22 hrs on 18 cds ) . the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable , loaded with period details . the last third is the worst : weir 's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation - - nay , elevation - - of queen isabella to the role of long-suffering , much-wronged , highly-deserving , and late-redeemed just queen of england . this book is really " subjective , rhetorical biographal dramatization " . i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis . it is rhetoric because of the endless " weasel words " ( and expressions ) used copiously throughout : " some say " , " it has been said " , " many believe " , " therefore we may assume " , " it can be inferred " ... this is n't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively . these expressions occur many hundreds of times , commonly in conjunction with wier 's subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light , always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons . equally irksome is weir 's double-standard of historical psychological analysis . she is always ' declaring ' for us the contents of isabella 's thoughts . remarkable gift she has for this . many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful . but then moments later she will portray isabella 's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how isabella must have , might have , could have , would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history . this is n't historical writing , it is historical op-ed , with an obvious agenda . i do n't loathe this work , it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail . the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing . but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography . ( other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris ' " rise of theodore roosevelt " and " theodore rex " . i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject , lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence . yuck . really . ) if prefer more history when reading ( or listening to ) history . and much , much less editorial subjectivity , retroactive psychology , biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation . the only way i could enjoy " isabella " by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly , taking it with " several pounds of salt " as the above referenced reviewer advises . 2.5 / 5
1534,price went up ! ! ! great value for money spent . will be buying a " ball " attachment for better adjustability . got some great steady shots with 48x digital zoom with the canon s2 i
1535,i agree with everyone that wants old nick . i remember putting on the tv and watching legends of the hidden temple , guts , are you afraid of the dark ? and so on . put them on dvd . people would surely buy it
1536,have n't had to clean it yet and it keeps the humidity level in out daughter 's room between 41 and 53%. we have had it for 3 months now and no problems at all . works as advertised and worth every penny
1537,it 's quite a bit slower than version 7. but it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds
1538,there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano , he would have composed for it . let 's consider another possibility : if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep , he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea , since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers . for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament , it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these " pedagogical " compositions . in other words , the point is lost .
1539,the sony cybershot is a great camera . the colors and the features are amazing . is very easy to use . the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button . if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out .
1540,theodore b . taylor , the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004 , but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester . even though the text of this book originally appeared in " the new yorker " in 1973 , taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation . mcphee has a very understated style ( " just the facts , ma'am " ) , but this book is still the most frightening i 've ever read . i ca n't decide whether i would want him to write a sequel , because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973. just ask yourself the following questions : is there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there was in 1973 ? yes . do more nations have nuclear capability ? yes . can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more efficient than its 1973 counterpart ? yes . are the instructions for building a nuclear device more readily available than they were in 1973 ? yes . do some people hate america even more than they did in 1973 ? decide this one for yourself . john mcphee , staff writer for the " new yorker " and pulitzer-prize-winning author of twenty-seven books on subjects as various as oranges and the merchant marine , has written a nuclear explosion of a book in " the curve of binding energy . " it 's one of those books that is even more relevant now than when it was written . essentially , it 's a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device using materials at hand , along with a chunk of rather easily stolen u-235 or plutonium . theodore b . taylor , himself the creator of smaller , more efficient nuclear bombs , tells us where to steal the plutonium , how to assemble a bomb , even gives hints on where to plant it- -one of the eeriest parts of this book has taylor and mcphee exploring the now-vanished towers of the world trade center , trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device could do the most damage . " the curve of binding energy " is a must read for every man , jack , and paper-pusher in the department of homeland security , not to mention both houses of congress . i imagine the first reaction of many congresspersons would be to ban this book , but it 's way too late for that , my friend .
1541,they arrived on time and after that everything went downhill . the batteries charged lasted atleast five hours , so no complaints there , but the charger would keep coming out from the wall . it only seemed to work if it was all the way in and it would n't stay all the way in , i tried several outlets , finally after a whole two months it no longer worked at all
1542,capsule monsters is a new game that requires capsule shooter . yugi must save the world from a new evil . but first he must master this new game . yugi is on a quest to keep a power from falling into the hands of evil . this dvd only contains part 1 of the movie . part 2 will be release some time in september . so if you love the first yu-gi-oh . you will definitely wo n't to see this movie . bonus features deleted scenes capsule monster trailers
1543,[first of all : i only gave this one star because the rating does n't let you go any lower] i only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it , leaving me to pick it up . i proceeded to suffer through it so i could give you fair warning . if you buy this , consider yourself warned
1544,first of all , this software performs like someones term project . why havent these guys been sued yet ? pros : nice retail packaging cons : not tested doesnt burn all your files no support overall a waste of moner
1545,i have been working with this camera for about a year now , for product shots online , and while sometimes it takes great pics , many times the flash pops and whites out , or it goes off and you get a black picture . i take pictures of jewelry , and if i try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration , the color is not accurate . purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up . while you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings , in all different modes , you 'll never get the same picture twice , even saving the setting . the light has to be just so , to get a good shot . when it shoots clearly , it can take fabulous pictures , but often , pics are blurred as many others have said , when they actually come out . my old camera , the dsc p71 3.2 megapixel is much better , colors are accurate always , shooting is flawless and foolproof every time , and the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading . this feature is completely missing from the dsc p200 , which was the biggest disappointment , as i figured it would be a given i did n't have to ask about when purchasing . why would sony eliminate this great function ? had i know that when the salesman at the large new york city photo store told me this was the camera i dreamed of , i would not have bought it . i prefer also to use the rechargable aa batteries instead of the lithium battery , which is super hard to load , and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with . it is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle . every time it takes me several minutes , and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem . i recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to dvd . sound quality is good , but video quality can be choppy , and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed , so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings i made . the monitor , while big , does not show you always what you are shooting , whether a still , or movie picture . overall , i would not recommend this camera and i actually bought a used second of my old camera , and got my original repaired , because this one does n't compare . this camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly . even after using all this time , i still am not sure what i am going to get when i use this camera . i 'd say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color , this camera clearly has trouble showing blue / green shades , and purples accurately , you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera , and the lack of the " trimming " resizing feature , what was sony thinking ? next time , i am trying something other than sony cybershot unless i hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward , uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera . this one is definitely not
1546,if you like redon for his vibrant color , look for another book . dream symbolism and spirituality that inspired redon 's imagery are the main topics of this book . most of the many examples are black and white drawings . however , the real magic of redon is his use of color in his mature works . this was not adequately represented .

1548,my husband is very pleased with his " self-cleaning " razor , although he did n't like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs . it 's an excellant appliance
1549,i like most of ac / dc 's music , but i ca n't stand their latest album stiff upper lip . stiff upper lip is the only ac / dc album where you can play it all the way through , and not even hear one good song . stiff upper lip does n't even come close to being as good as back in black or highway to hell . every song on it just bugs the heck out of me . listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience ; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy ! the overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like highway to hell or back in black . but...those cds had variety , they were semi original , and they were actually pretty good . this cd is just completely worthless . i have heard some cra ppy cds in my lifetime , but none of them were more pain to listen to than this . the vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums , the music is chunky , repetitive , dull , and boring , and most of the songs sound the same . stiff upper lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band . the music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks . this cd is just unbelievaby terrible . it is a disgrace to this band 's legacy , and the band members should be embarrased by it . oh well , i guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract , so i guess they do n't care about how awful it is anyway . all i can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible . it is a total piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to . go buy a good ac / dc cd like let there be rock , high voltage , powerage , highway to hell , or back in black . stiff upper lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise . it 's so awful i 'd rather listen to the new nickelback cd than this !
1550,sure , this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics , but the question you should be asking yourself is , will it appeal to the average person ? the simple answer here is a loud and resounding no . here are the reasons : 1 ) unless you 're a well-bred blue blood who knows all about edward ii and loves shakespeare , this is extremely hard to follow , not just because of the archaic olde english-speake , but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence . result ? if you 're not lost you will soon will be , and worse yet , you wo n't care ; 2 ) do n't be fooled by the lure of annie lennox-she is an itsy-bit of a bit player in the overall run of this " movie " and is , for all intents and purposes , inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an mtv commercial rammed in the middle of your programme ; 3 ) let 's be clear about what you 're getting for your 10-15 dollars : it 's not a movie at all , but an arty-pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie . further , the " period " is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new , making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short , not what cutty-edgy-trendy-theme-within-a-theme are they trying to promote . who knew such a tantillizing , heart-wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull ?
1551,i used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades . i have always cut myself occasionally , but when i cut myself with the fusion power , i got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar ! talk about sharp ! i went back to using it and then a month or so later i cut myself again and this one was even worse . you could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin . i tossed the fusion in the garbage , went back to the 3-blade , and wrote gillette an e-mail to complain , to which they did not respond . i 've read all 60 reviews before mine , and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem . maybe it 's my shaving technique , but this thing is a weapon
1552,this thing is horrible . cumbersome to use and does nothing . i have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor . it removes a little bit of dirt but does n't actually clean a rug / carpet . i 'm giving it one star because amazon wo n't let me rate it -0
1553,this is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time . surprisingly , evans ' introspective style and cannonball 's soulful approach meld together perfectly . perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are . both the technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing . i 've owned this cd for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings . highlights are the amazing & quot ; waltz for debby&quot ; and earl zindars ' waltz & quot ; elsa&quot ; , easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written , in my opinion . you simply cannot go wrong with this cd
1554,i hate to admit i actually own this thing on vhs . and unless my mind is going more than usual , i have this cut of the movie too . double ( and more ) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of dvd . we get at least four issues of terminator 2 , but none of robinson crusoe on mars . i personally am sick of it . director 's cuts , unrated editions , and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet . no wonder i 've taken to borrowing nearly all my dvds from the public library . no , you generally do n't get them the day they come out . but honestly , when was the last time you purchased a movie from hollyweird that was worth keeping ? do n't do it
1555,by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years . it 's true , the patriots somehow pieced together a team that , despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17-2 record ( which just as easily could have / should have been 18-1 ) ...but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just does n't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003. part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities ( 2001 having 9 / 11 , the coming-of-age of tom brady , the snow bowl , and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever . 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy , the early stumbles to buffalo and washington , the birth of the winning streak , winter weather in foxboro , and yet another thrilling super bowl finish ) ; 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison , like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the " w " on the patriots ' side of the field . this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries ( leading to the incredible " throwback " two-way play of veteran wide receiver / rookie cornerback troy brown ) , the continued winning streak , the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon , the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts , and the return to pittsburgh ( where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween ( just days after the red sox won the world series , karmically enough ) , where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl , this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville , fl . no nail-biting endings this time , though...despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else ( with the possible exception of curt schilling , of course ) , the eagles all-pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day ( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick , actually ) and the patriots , though trailing early , never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved . far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum-drum , but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that , impressive as it was , just does n't translate to the memorable re-telling that the pats ' previous title years do . this is a great dvd for pats fans , indispensible even , but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring , i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd 's over this one
1556,for years i used powerquest 's drive image 7 for backups . it 's rock solid and totally dependable . when symantec aquired powerquest they rolled the underlying technology of drive image 7 into norton ghost . the result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups . most importantly , like drive image 7 , it provides for emergency recovery of your system . just boot from the ghost cd and restore the backup ( restore point ) that you select . i 've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups , and then restoring the system from those backups . the process works flawlessly . if you need to restore to a different physical drive ( replaced a failed drive , etc ) , the process requires a few extra selections , but is still very straightforward . just take the time to read the manual . i 've seen acronis true image recommended by some both here and elsewhere . i 've tried acronis and find it lacking in one major respect : it simply is not reliable . during trials , i made backups with acronis . acronis indicated that the backups were successful but , when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later , acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used . the backups were worthless . when purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles do n't count for anything . the only thing that counts is reliability . it must be able to reliably restore your system . norton ghost passes that test with flying colors .
1557,as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway 's latest offering . let me first say that i am a fan of this group , which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom , but what i heard was bluegrass muzak . yes , the group 's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence , and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller , but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing . gospel music , even bluegrass gospel , has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves . a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous , some serious and contemplative , some that push the envelope of orthodoxy , and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners . this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards . my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new , or buy used . want mine
1558,i was a huge fan of the jam , but ive grown to despise paul weller and this cd strengthens my view . this is a covers cd and has n't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.with paul weller everything is about a quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations , rarities , box sets and dvd 's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].this album is bland so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto
1559,this is a great fiber supplement ! ! when you chew it , it starts out kind of crunchy but quickly turns chewy kind of like a chewy sweet-tart . i usually keep a glass of water by even thou it says you do n't need water . they have a good flavor and yes i do use it as a substitute for candy every once in a while . just remember too much of a good thing will give you gas : - ) so do n't be in a small elevator .
1560,this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position . i sent the camera for warranty service ( i had it less than 7 months ) , and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off . they claimed this happened due to physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract . do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new . even then , do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty . i had another a410 that did the very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service ( so i suppose it was no loss after all ) . obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside . in short , this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field . if you buy it , and plan to use it a lot , expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty ( which i 'm not doing ) soon .
1561,office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word- -anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988. another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997. apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them- -such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier
1562,i was so disappointed with this cd . at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums....scratches and all ! they were so bad . i play two of the songs over and over...the only two i liked . when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs , i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song....i was wrong . i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music..a filler ? i would quickly skip to another song...only to have to " skip " many times !
1563,this spotting scope from bushnell is an excellent buy if you are an outdoors person or if you like watching the world from your window . you can even view the craters on the moon . plus it 's waterproof and comes with two cases and a tripod . the amazon price is the best deal on the internet
1564,this software is very hard to use . the help video goes too fast , the manual does n't cover everything and nothing is intuitive . i have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money
1565,beware of poor cs policy at jvc . they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built . they were not interested in even trying to help . i hate it when companies only care about their profits
1566,too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on cds like this . john rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting . the music overwhelms the senses and the joy of christmas overcomes you as you listen . this is one of the most peaceful christmas cds i have ever heard . " wassail song " is incredible , and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble , this song is a must to perform . you will not be disappointed when you purchase this cd
1567,the very first thing i noticed was how small and crammed the case was . it was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something . the other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was . the bonnnet was difficult to get on , mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place , and kept pulling the bonnet off my head . after a couple of trys and reading the instructions , i knew i would never use it , simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head . whoever designed this product should be demoted
1568,i bought this cd for " hole in the earth " , a very dynamic , driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker , and mostly got what i expected - more of the same along a continuum , sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction , as i expected . and then i came upon " pink cellphone " , a rotten apple if there ever was one . this vile little stinker is as if one of the band 's groupies wandered into the control room in a methamphetamine haze , defecated on the mixing board , and then described her experience , in no uncertain terms , into an answering machine . if there was ever a reason to switch from buying an artist 's complete cds to just purchasing individual tracks off of the web , this is it . congratulations , guys , you have not only lodged a very descriptive and literally filthy image into my head , but convinced me , and i 'd wager , many listeners , that our faith is ill placed with the musical choices that pop musicians make when assembling their " b " sides . to say nothing of the bad taste and lack of respect for your audience that this demonstrates . someone should wash the deftones ' mouths out with a bar of soap - maybe a few bars .
1569,i received this for christmas from my amazon wishlist . i wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing . i was a long time user of norelco shavers , but switched to a blade since i could n't get a close enough shave . now that the whiskers are mostly gray , you ca n't tell for a few days if i shaved or not , so closeness is no longer an issue . i typically use this shaver in the shower , and have noticed that if you wash your face first , it takes more of the cool skin creme to give a smooth , close shave . just a hint , guys . for the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles , dimples and adam 's apple cleanly with very little drag . my only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the ' stash & sideburns while showering . small complaint that does n't remove any ratings stars . all in all a great shaver
1570,i first bought the standard , and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well . i used them riding a bike in the winter months . neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit . for the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering ( and prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above the ear . the rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists .
1571,first off , let me say that i know next to nothing about art . i would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork , but it certainly does not come naturally - especially when it comes to modern art . dali , however , is a master i at least have some affinity with . who does n't know of the melting clocks ? i have also seen the dream sequence he created for hitchcock 's film spellbound in 1945. plus , the guy was just plain weird , and that is something i know a little bit about myself . this artists of the 20th century dvd looks solely at dali 's artwork . all you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another . there is no biographical look at the man , no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings , and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality ( or mustache ) . there is not even an adequate identification of gala , his inspiration and muse , despite numerous references to her in his paintings . thus , this dvd will not introduce you to dali the man or dali the artist - it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro . dali 's artwork is obviously impressive , and i was surprised by the variety of his work and styles . the narrator offers insight into some paintings - others , you just look and advance . i do n't understand a lot of dali 's work , nor can i see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces . the melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me . dark works such as visage of war speak volumes to the human observer , and the disappearing bust of voltaire paintings are also striking . i was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces dali painted , however - largely because i did not know he ever produced such works . my idea of a painting equates with something like design for the interior decoration of a stable-library , which is a strikingly beautiful work . is this dvd worth watching ? i will have to say no . if you 're a know-nothing novice like me , there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown . if you 're knowledgeable about dali , you 'll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite dali works excluded from the show . after watching this , i decided to peruse some dali galleries online , and i must say that the internet makes this dvd of little value . not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video , the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the dvd
1572,look i really despise bush . he 's an idiot . and i know people are gonna have different opinions on that . but what i wish wouldnt happen is people giving this 5 stars cause its against bush and they agree . seriously the music is really not good . however if you do buy it make sure you watch the dvd eh ? its got a great will farrel skit on it . 2 stars for that and the few decent songs on here ( ie no w by the ministry ) thats all
1573,even though i am not a streisand fan , i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was . the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand 's character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - to the main male character . the problem is , she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks that highlighted hair , a tight black cocktail dress , and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , and everyday looks are disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that 's the fallacy alarm going off : men , in my experience , do n't care much about clothes and makeup . ) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character 's losing weight by riding an exercise bike , but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand , discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother ( played by lauren bacall ) , blubbers , " wazz i a pretty baby ? wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee ? " in that one scene , streisand 's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed . the whole movie is about this issue , and it 's amazing that an entire cast , crew , and production company would devote themselves to b.s. 's emotional issues like that . i really think that the " funny girl " phenomenon somehow ruined streisand 's thought processes . the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped , northern european beauty standard of the time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman.... . ) . i recall reading about how her glowing complexion , thick hair , and good figure ( as well as her energy and voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly does n't look like grace kelly.... . so why ca n't she accept this ? the majority of us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn to live with and love who we are.....at least i hope we do ! this movie is not about that . this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable . maybe i should 've given it only one star
1574,i trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that i am dumbfounded and left speechless . during backup process i selected about 15gb of info to backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except for two ( 2 ) simple errors that i received , indicating that those related files may not have been copied / backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files / errors out 15gb , i could handle that . based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files and financial files to include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded to slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process . everything looked great . during the restore process , i then received numerous errors , each of them requiring me to click ' yes ' when asked if i wanted to proceed . i got tired of clicking yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no . when you click ' no ' , everything is undone ; there is no ' ignore all ' function so i had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me . i then selected a smaller group of files to have restored , only the ' my documents ' folder but ran into the same situation . eventually i ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through . hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored . my guess is approximately 2 / 3 or 3 / 4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it . i had the latest update applied to the program , so that should not be the cause . i would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as i would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches , frustrations and an investment of hours , no days of my time . the program has been recently purchased by microsoft for inclusion in the vista os , i imagine . it will do well as a microsoft product , as it fails to deliver upon its promises
1575,i always love it when prevention release another workout because i get bored easy and i like to mix workouts up . i 've loved all of the other prevention workouts and knew i 'd love this too . chris freytag leads again and does another superb job . there are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts . the dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want . that 's a big plus so you do n't get bored or pushed for time . you can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc. if , for example , you pick that you need to lose weight , there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already . that is so helpful . the moves are all basic no frills moves , but they are effective . the first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder . the body parts are all the ones you want to workout ; arms , butt , abs and thighs . all you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy . this is so easy to do due to the programming , so there really is no excuse for not working out . this can be done by practically anyone . i also love how the other two girls exercising as well , are n't the kinds that yell and shout etc. they are as professional as chris
1576,hugh farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play bridge . his college-age daughter karen , her friend barbara , his lawyer son duke , his alcoholic wife grace , and house servant joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit . everyone scrambles to safety inside hugh 's modern bomb shelter . as the bombs fall and his wife is passed out , hugh starts up an affair with his daughter 's friend barbara , right in the shelter . as if hugh 's shallowness and arrogance was n't enough to turn you against the protagonist , this nauseating little scene will . when the shakes and quakes finally end , the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible , pristine , clean world . at first glance , it looks like utopia , but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race , imprisoned , and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves . somehow , hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in , so that he can be free with barbara . of all the apocalypse fiction , this book is the worst . the protagonist is so lowbrow , so arrogant , so unlikable , so self-centered , so shallow , so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest . he 's not even a " love to hate " person . the dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant , and barbara and hugh 's constant prattlings of " darling , dear , and beloved " do not fit the characters . neither does hugh 's occasional spouting of words like " shall " and " sha n't " along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the " n " word . there is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of hugh 's daughter and barbara 's friend karen , cannibalism , castration ( hugh cared more about his " boys " than he did his real children ) , pedophilia , racism , and $exual slavery , they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut . the entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it , as if the author himself did n't quite believe his story . and if he does n't believe , how can he expect the reader to ? overall , there is no depth or flavor in this story at all , other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight , as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door . i recommend avoiding this book .
1577,i think this is the best book that i have ever read . i thought that the civil war was very , very boring but when our class started to read bull run i knew that i was wrong . the way that paul fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more . from the way paul fleischman described the characters to the words that paul flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye . each character has a different story of the war and of life . i would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the civil war . it supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn . this book was excellent from the first page i read . even though this novel is very brilliant , some people might not like it . if they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character , like one of my favorite characters dietrick herz . he had the funniest voice i ever heard . when paul fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging . but the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself . and trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book . the best that i have ever read and if i liked it then for surely you will love it too , trust me . before i read bull run i had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really , really new to me . i had to get use to it a little but since it was n't very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the bull run story by paul fleischman . some of the characters that i really liked was toby boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife . another was carlotta king because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what i mean by that is they can practice there own religion . another one of my favorite characters is vergil peavy . i think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story . in the story he sounds like he 's from texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes . and my last favorite character is shem suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with . shem suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses , that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses . but the reason i really really like him is because he minds his own business and does n't talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces . that is the reason why i like shem suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart
1578,i think this product is highly overated and this claim of being 99% accurate is false . once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100% accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when you realise that the very next sentence is complete gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted what you have in that manner . i think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an american accent may get good results while a person with a british or an australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training . in summary i think the program is unreliable with an accuracy of 45% at its present level of developement . it has plenty of potential and with future developement it could much more reliable but at its present level of developement i think the performance is mediocre .
1579,i found i did enjoy this movie , even though the director took liberties . it does n't follow so much the novel by jane austen , but if you have n't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons , this movie is enjoyable . i gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director , but did like what i saw
1580,the enclosure has a solid feel to it . i dove with it three times with no problem at all . it would be nice if the weight does not cost extra . the only compliant i have is that the enclosure is a tight fit , so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure
1581,version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users ' favorite features , like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become . more than anything , version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely , providing complete control over your document , who can open , print , or even comment on it . but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade , as it cures many of the ills of the previous version . best of all , adobe has kept the price the same . very nice
1582,many , many years ago when i was a very young woman , i saw my first carry on movie and went to see every one i could possibly get to . then , there were none . several years ago , my sister taped a copy of carry on cleo for me . i could n't believe i still roared at the silliness only the brits can successfully pull off . it must have been fate that led me to look up " carry on " on amazon a few months ago . my heart skipped a beat when the carry on collection came up . i instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times . my personal favorites : carry on constable , carry on cowboy , and carry on cabby . but they are all good . i 've loaned several movies to a brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the carry on series and who is now introducing them to his american family . they love them , too . if you love double-entendre done to perfection , do n't miss this collection
1583,i discovered this software by accident , while window shopping , and i ended up buying it and taking it home . i was able to get it up and running pretty quickly , and was creating my own music right out of the box . of course it takes some time , but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time . add a mic to your computer , and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording / editing studio , make your own music and burn it to cd . sounic foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web , by providing an online community of acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers ' work . you can also listen to music published by other users . even if you 're just a musical legend in your own living room , this makes it easy and fun to become just that . sound forge also sells music loops on cd especially for acid , but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work . sound forge also provides weekly samples for free on their acid planet website
1584,ordered 5 allergen covers from this vendor ; 2 had defective zippers ( would not close after opening ) . image the fun of wrestling with your large mattress and then discover the zipper will not close
1585,the case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only . then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses . it makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera . you can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack . my digital rebel xt fits with the canon battery grip and my macro lens attached , however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached . my canon speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag . the lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them . i bought a regular lowepro camera bag , but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached . this bag is designed to have the camera with a lens . if you search google images for the lowepro slingshot 200 you will see what i mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal .
1586,wow ! i 'm really impressed ! i 've had trouble cleaning under my bridge . i can fish floss under there and clean it good , but it takes a lot of time . now i just blast it clean in minutes . it does a good job of cleaning my back teeth . i 've never been totally satisfied with just flossing . now they feel perfectly clean . i love this device ! it does n't replace flossing . it does a great job under the gums , but i still feel cleaner after flossing . it 's great as a between brushing " touchup " . i recommend it to anyone . my mouth has n't felt this clean in years . i feel like i 've come from the dentist after a cleaning . thats a great feeling to have every day
1587,i have tried lots of protein powders . i get online the low-carb , low-calorie protein powders as i am just trying to put on muscle and it is hard to find one that you can stomach . i was stuck on champions whey ( chocolate ) for the past year as the best but i just got my shipment of the gold standard - cookies & cream and it is amazing ! i love this stuff . i tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was tremendous . i am going to have this before and after my daily workout , but best yet , rather than binging on any ice cream desires late at night , i am going to get a scoop of fat free frozen vanilla yogurt , put a scoop of this in with some fat free milk and i have my fat free protein shake
1588,first off : i 'd like it better if we had 1 / 2-star options . judas unchained really does n't deserve a 2 , more a 2-1 / 2 or 2-3 / 4. i have a love / hate relationship with peter hamilton 's books . he 's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but , as with a lot of these hard-science , libertarian sf authors , he badly needs an editor . i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel , pandora 's star . he also has far too many " main characters " who ( despite 800+ pages ) never seem to come alive . they all speak with essentially the same voice . and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped ' 60s era hippies - - come on , does anyone seriously say " dude " in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century ? and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young ( or rejuvenated ) women ? hamilton 's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best . on the one hand , the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed , represented and believable . on the other hand , the dynamics of the relationship between " old timers " and " first lifers " is unsatisfactory . in four centuries , for example , no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty ? perhaps the commonwealth 's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here , the government ( controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties ) controls it . another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life did n't change - - i mean the characters of a novel ( almost by definition ) are dynamic , go-get - 'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die . why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime ? the aliens are ok . the problem with them ( and this is true of nearly every sf story ) is that they tend to be one dimensional - - they 're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up . ( this is a problem in fantasy stories , too . ) on the plus side , i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien " deus ex machina . " ozzie 's adventures in " wonderland " ( i.e. , the silfen paths ) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge does n't really help anyone defeat the primes . overall , if you started with pandora 's star , you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained . if you have n't started down this " silfen path , " i recommend alistair reynolds , tony daniel or iain banks . they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date
1589,crashed the system every time i tried to use it.. . gave me such a headache i tossed it in the trash.. .
1590,do n't waste your time and money ! ! extremely poor product support ! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit , then you 're stuck with worthless software . i installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it . then my computer crashed and i lost everything . i thought i was covered since i just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when i tried to do a restore norton ghost would n't recognize my external hard disk . i spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours . nobody called ! i bought their extended download service and tried to download the product again . it did n't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone i still have n't got a working copy . the product key they said i needed and i tried to use also does n't work . i 'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but i expect the same result - no credit back and software that does n't do what norton said it would do
1591,i ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out . loved it , so i ordered a full and kingsize too ! i find i do n't move around as much as i used to . a more restfull sleep
1592,i have always been a fan of the star wars saga but never really read any of the novels . this was my first sw novel . i must say i want to be a sith . i just finished this novel last night and honestly want a 2nd coming . if u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth ! the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the sw ripple effects . i however got more excited because i played kotor / ep3 the game / kotor 2 and jedi academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games . i loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the jedi in ep3. it an amazing story and ca n't wait to a sequel if any .
1593,this is a rather peculiar film for seagal , and the first thing that should be pointed out to any seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film . seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief . in fact , they are extraordinarily brief , though thankfully free of wirefu . though out of reach is by no means a total failure ( it 's actually pretty entertaining , seagal as always is fun to watch , and some of the scenes are well done ) , the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes . this film is a drama about a nature nut ( seagal ) who roams the forest looking for injured animals . he has a pen pal in poland , a young girl , and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her , even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her . this brings up the main problem with this film , namely , a lot of it simply does n't make any sense . it turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring , and seagal goes through the motions to save her . as per usual with seagal nowadays , he obviously refused to actually finish the production , and so we have the usual dubbing problem here . it is even more salient than usual in this picture , however , for here we have not one , but several different people dubbing seagal 's voice , none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him ! here the most frequently heard fill-in for seagal sounds like a knock-off benecio del toro with a much higher-pitched voice . as you can imagine , the effect is very humorous . as stated above , the main problem with this movie is that it simply does n't make sense , which was apparently realized by the director , as he has , in many scenes , the voice fill-in for seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking ! how obnoxious ! seagal 's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal , which she later uses to communicate with seagal . what makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for seagal , the villian , ineptly played by matt schultz , sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for seagal to find ! in one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code . ( apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means " this is a trap . " ) the villain sees her doing this , and , instead of destroying the message ( which would make sense ) , later has it delivered to seagal ! huh ? in a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling seagal where she is , the villian sees her doing it , comments on how clever she is , but then leaves the message ! there are also quite of few mistakes in this film , several of which are laughably obvious . at the beginning and end of this film , for example , seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy , black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head . during the rest of the film , however , he has short hair . at the end , after some bs macho dialogue about how seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing schultz slowly , each character uncocks his pistol even though schultz 's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock , and even though in the very next closeup seagal 's pistol is still cocked ! after a sword fight , which ends on a classic move from older chambara films , notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor , and that then , all-of-a-sudden , there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters . in the finale , the above-mentioned sword fight , the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than seagal . this brings up another frequent complaint of many seagal fans : his overuse of stunt doubles . it 's almost so bad now that one could say that he does n't even film his own fight scenes now . have you ever noticed that in lord steven 's early films , when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves ? now what happens ? the camera gets as close as possible , shows some shots of his face grunting , shows some arms playing paddycake , then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing seagal 's face . ever wonder why ? it 's because , surprise , surprise , that 's not seagal doing the fighting . in the gun fight , which is actually a very decent action scene , watch seagal as he enters the room . his character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll , which is probably the simplest move in aikido , though it is obvious that it is not seagal doing the roll . what is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film , which shows seagal 's character " roaming the forest looking for injured animals , " or whatever , it is clearly not seagal that we see walking through the forest . was he afraid that he 'd trip over a branch and injure himself ? was he afraid he 'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods ? i do n't know . what is likely the case is that seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact , using another actor , in order to make the film work . i 'm really not bashing seagal , i 'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could very easily be fixed . be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when seagal goes to the post office . the postal worker calls seagal " mr. delacraw , " or some such bizarre name , even though his character 's name is actually billy ray lancing . seagal then proceeds to mumble some french to the man , and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent . this scene is downright strange . what is also strange is how seagal is dressed in this scene- -like some kind of new orleans anne rice fan , vampire wannabe in a strange , black fur coat . i do n't know , at least it 's good for a laugh . if seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable . the only truly schocking thing is that this has n't happened yet . he shows up late to shoots , leaves early , refuses to finish productions , and yet people keep hiring the man . he repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production . he needs to start finishing his films . in closing , out of reach only has two very brief fight scenes , but they are somewhat well done . seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight , which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human .
1594,this is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size . we bought it to replace our bulkier sony dsc-f707. the large screen is wonderful ! the video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video . the battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left . the main downside with this camera is the flash . it does n't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots . if it were n't for the flash , i would have given this a rating of 5 stars . this is overall a good camera . for more serious digital photography , we prefer to use the sony dsc-f707 as it has a better flash and zoom . however , it is too bulky to carry around
1595,gerry marsden and his pacemakers are great . i just want to point out that the double-cd ' best of ' import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price . there is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import
1596,this cd was devoid of any of govi 's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work . frankly , it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators . some of the craig chaquico-style stuff was interesting , but better left to craig . try 7th heaven , mosaico or guitar odyssey instead
1597,where to begin ? cliched . pretentious . flat . static . maudlin . melodramatic . homophobic . and finally , just plain boring . start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute patsy cline young drag queen arriving the big city , pile on cardboard " colorful " characters like typical aids patient , porno star , and loud-mouthed latina hot mamna , and whaddya get ? an amateur film populated with some of the most unlikable , unattractive characters ever , all spewing some of the unbelievably bad dialogue ever written - and to think the ( formerly talented ) director made the whole wide world also with d'onofrio ? go figure . nice cover art , though
1598,a bunch of junk . not any of the really meaty excersises . an excuse for the auhor to make money
1599,i 'd give it 0 starts if that was an option ! a total piece of crap ! try cleaning it , and the head falls apart ! try putting it back together , and plan on doing nothing else for a long time ! do not buy this razor
1600,my husband tried this after i bought it and he loves it . it is a great remedy for a hangover or even just a bad morning . it is very hard to find in most drugstores . now i just buy it on the internet . i 've even recommended it to friends who now swear buy it
1601,aquazone is good , but i 've found that serene scene is a better product . aquazone is not as realistic as serene scene and that is what i was looking for . the realism of fish in an aquarium . if i could go back i would buy serene scene instead
1602,i did not get my order . you were suppoused to send my money back . i am waiting . thank
1603,yeah its great . get rid of ur piece of doo-doo windows operating system and pick yo self up dis ! aight piece yallz . and remember once yo go mac ya neva go back
1604,i 'm not sure how well since i have never used anything like this before , but my bath water feel a whole lot better and i do not itch for an hour afterwards . i probably should have rated a 5 star , but i really have no base for comparing . i will definitely buy this product again .
1605,i purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was pg that it would be fine . also , the market for transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere . wow , were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie . these were not just words like shoot or dang , but the real deal . i remember transformers when i was growing up and i certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons . i am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking . who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office . concerned in alabam
1606,aside from the typical minor quarks , this is overall a good product . i 've been using turbo tax for many years and it seems to work for me
1607,and now a word from david lynch , as spoken by dean stockwell as doctor yueh in dune : " the tooth . the tooooootttttttth . remember the tooth . " seriously , my daughter loves dora the explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her teeth for longer than two minutes . i bought this dora the explorer battery powered electric toothbrush , and she does . game . set . match . best money i ever spent on simultaneous child and parent satisfaction . when i tested this model on my finger , i was surprised at how powerful it was for a child-sized unit . this electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off her skull , but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing . battery life is okay , i estimate it costs about ½ a cent for her to brush her teeth each time . the future value of that expenditure is far lower than the dental bills i 'd otherwise have , so this is a money saving unit . if your child in a member of the dora cultus , this is one of the better items to own
1608,greatest hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea . most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact , but this wears thin with repeated listenings . this is especially true of gangsta rap . with what allegedly should represent the best work of b-t-h on one disk , this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself . arranged back to back , the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin . the raps blur together , and after two songs , the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value , sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision . once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention , all that remains are the rhythm tracks , which are serviceable at best . their biggest hit , " tha crossroads " , appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form , further reducing the value of this collection . worse , they include a warmed-over version of " f - tha police " , an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of nwa 's original . spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles . it might have had some value when it first hit the stands , but who wants yesterday 's papers ? c tom rya
1609,this lens has gotten some bad reviews , i think , partly because it is starting to show it 's age . this was the first usm is lens , and the technology has really grown since then . if canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 usm is lens , man , it would blow everything away . that being said , yes , this lens is a little slow to focus . but , if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games , you should be okay . it also could use an extra stop ( or two , or three ! ) because when you are handholding , you need that aperture to be as open as it can be . all of this aside , i really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens . it lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for . if you have asteady hand and plently of availible light , you can get some really nice shots . if you are in a low light situation.. . you will need a tripod . the is of lens works.. . pretty good , but i have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that would n't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with . all in all , its a good starter telephoto lens , especially for digital slrs since it really extends the zoom on those . its great for the price , and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon l beauties , just sell it
1610,i was a student of mr. clawson 's , and highly recommend any student of his to use this book as a study guide
1611,after just over a year , my lens jammed and the display read " e18 " . so i was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that canon refuses to admit . try googling canon s500 e18 " , and you 'll see what i meant . do n't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight
1612,they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was . the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad-mouth the warrior . maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other . they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations . vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test . as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they 're talking about steroids . but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use . let 's not talk about that - let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior . and they also just try to badmouth him so much . who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him ? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including hulk . and oh yeah - they do n't even let the warrior defend himself . why did i have to find out from imdb.com that he was asked to appear but declined ? why do n't they address this ? this " docu " is more slanted than " fahrenheitt 911 " every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking .
1613,got this game for my 12 year old and he loves it ! you need to have a pretty new computer to use it and it took a few trys to get it downloaded . once it was installed it was a really wonderful game ! if you have a child that likes puzzles and figuring things out , they will love it too
1614,layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time . cream is one of the most boring bands in history . why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like dire straits , and metallica who rock . ps.this clapton compilation has no good songs so please do n't buy it at all
1615,the idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good , but in practice zonealarm is too intrusive for most home computer users . it seems to have bugs too , starting with an installation that initially would n't work on one of the computers on my home lan . zonealarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered . i have n't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall zonealarm yet , but i 'm close
1616,i purchased this camera primarily as a back-up camera . but i find myself using it more and more inplace of my main camera . it is a beautiful piece of work
1617,shavers fall into two categories , those who prefer rotaries like the norelco and those who prefer foil shavers . for those of you who like foil shavers , this is the one for you ! i 've owned the latest braun 8985 and it was excellent , while it lasted.. . the charger kept breaking on me ( once in the first month [11 / 2006] , then another time 4 months later [3 / 2007] ) . it was expensive , and the refills were a pain , pricey , but they worked . after two exchanges i decided to try the norelco 8140xl ( speed xl ) rotaries , and while they shaved really close , they tore up my neck . the problem only got worse . returned 3 weeks later . i just got the panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors . they shave much faster than the braun and norelcos . i 'm not sure if i like the " side to side " pivoting head , only time will tell . the heads do n't pivot up and down as much as the braun , but once again , time will tell if this is necessary . one major advantage is that it cleans with soap and water.. . no expensive refills to hassle over . the panasonic has two noticeable downsides : 1. it 's louder than other shavers , but who cares ? it shaves incredibly fast anyway . 2. you ca n't plug it in and shave.. . you have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on . this is my favorite razor by far .
1618,this video was not animated like the classic chuck jones features such as " the cat in the hat " and " the grinch " . my daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation . we give this video a thumbs down
1619,a close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera . honestly olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400. i 've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10. if you 're going to spend that much on a camera , get the d70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with . the pictures are better and it offers more mp
1620,i have been a user of paperport since version 9 , skipped the upgrade to 10 because of bad reviews , received an upgrade notice in the mail , so i decided to buy it . it turns out it was a bad decision . the scanner that i use with 11 is the same as with 9 and is on nuance 's hardware compatibility list . the problem is , it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with paperport . then , when i did get it installed - and i used the advanced setup option with it , tested it , all looked good - except everytime i scan something , the program crashes ! it is literally unusable as a scanning solution . i have seen a few companies with products that were once really good , sell it off to another company , and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned . it seems that this may be the case . there are no updates or bug fixes for 11 , and i will not buy another paperport version in the future . i will attempt to go back to 9 , and probably stay with that . if i run into any issues with it over time , i will look elsewhere , and i recommend others do the same . i normally do n't write reviews for products , but this one is so poor , i just had to warn people
1621,if you are interested in cheap tricks rather than substance , this is the book for you . there is no easy way to learn japanese . there are easier ways , but no easy ways . where is the beef ? not here
1622,i bought this camera for my 16 year old granddaughter and she just loves it . the pics are bright and clear and the camera is very easy to handle
1623,for ina claire ninotchka was a last chance to show posterity what she could do , for there would n't be many film opportunities offered her . she 'd been a leading lady of the stage for nigh on thirty years , and her elegant beauty , very much a high-bred dina merrill type look , was still aglow . she was one of carl van vechten 's favorite subjects and he took photo after photo of her , staring imperiously against a wall of baize , or reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde hair . she suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at mgm , when her part in i take this woman was taken away from her and given to the cheaper verree teasdale . her director , josef von sternberg was also let go , and in fact the whole picture was redone so many times studio wags called it i re-take this woman ! the " woman " in question was hedy lamarr ; after ina claire 's hilarious showdowns with garbo in ninotchka , the studio might have thought her perfect for the part of lamarr 's central european rival . a year or so later , and edmund goulding put her to work as dorothy mcguire 's mother in the charming , underrated claudia , but that is definitely a mother part and as such , put an end to ina claire 's film career . as the countess " swana " she gets lots of billy wilder 's best lines and laughs . she 's not afraid of anyone , much less garbo . much has been written about the chemistry between garbo and melvyn douglas , indeed a delightful mix , but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without swana 's steely , icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations . in real life ina claire lived on to a great old age . she was 92 when the last curtain fell for her , and here in san francisco , where she spent most of her life , all the lights in her building went off for an hour , precisely at 8:30 , while her fans stood on the street , devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans surrounding the dakota hotel when john lennon died
1624,although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .
1625,i followed texhnolyze through it 's fansubs , waited patiently for each dvd to come out . you do n't have to sit and ponder , look hard and deep to find a meaning in texhnolyze . it hits you right in the face from the beginning . there are some people out there that society likes to forget . likes to shove to the backburners and ignore . in this tale , they are a whole race of people - the people of the underground city of lux . and even within them , sides are chosen . you 're either in or your out . ichise is one of these outcasts and he lives by what he knows . the only thing he knows - his strength , his brute force . this point is particularly brought out in one of the last episodes , when ichise makes the decision to protect ran . he 's come to feel something for the girl and , perhaps , in a way she reminds him of the mother he could never save . so he goes to offer the only thing he 's sure of having - his body . that 's always been his bargaining chip , always been what everyone wanted . anger , rage and fighting . though are all ichise knows . how do you expect him to act any less animalistic than the animal this society made him become ? it 's clear through most of the show that he does n't know how to react to people . likewise , it 's the same old sort of theme out of many a popular sci-fi movie - man bringing about an end to his own world . ichise inadvertantly is thrust into all of this by his texhnolyze , ran is thrust by her visions and everyone else by some intricate connection . but eventually , lux collapses because of technology , the classic warning given in so many apocalypse movies . not each episode requires such in-depth searches for meaning . it all fits into the grandier scheme and message of the series itself . this series , as a whole , is a very good series . it does require connecting together pieces and keeping larger themes in mind , as well as a little psychology but what good series / does n't /
1626,this game can get very boring . it 's very confusing and hard to control . it is sooooo frustrating ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the instruction booklet does n't come in handy either . like some other people , i only got rabbits too . i bought this game because i wanted to heal cats and horses . but , only rabbits came . buying this game was a big mistake . it is reallly no fun . do n't waste your money on this game . i gave up about a month ago . i 've left it on the shelf and have n't touched it since .
1627,for those who have only heard the hits this is a fine addition for your collection . bruce and the boys were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long jams you find here . the title sums up the overall feeling of the songs . there 's a certain joy and a ton of fun to be had . put this on one nice warm spring day and see if it does n't lift your mood . caution : must be listened to while drinking a cold domestic beer
1628,my 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him . and i also do n't like the washout look when i uses flash . so i researched about which slr will best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments and low light photos without flash . the canon 30d comes up top on the list . it has the best high iso performance in its class ( better than nikon and sony ) . and when i combine the 30d with the fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f / 2.8 is , the result is amazing . i can stop any action in daylight , capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode , and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even the dimly-lit decors of the disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there for the halloween party at night , without flash or tripod . this is really an important factor for me to buy this camera , as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old . but you will need a good lens to make this work well . if you use a cheap kit lens , then it will probably not matter which camera you pick . remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens ( not the kit lens ) and crop the pictures to magnify the details . the sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and do n't need low light performance ( use flash and save money ) . the nikon has more custom function than canon , and it is really as good as canon . they both have their strength and weakness . canon just happens to have slightly better high iso performance and that suits my need better than nikon . to be fair , i should mention that the nikon d200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year , beating the canon 30d overall . but the d200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me , better suits someone more serious about photography . the d80 is like a " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend . shooting in low light without flash will need good high iso performance , a good fast lens ( with wide aperture , usually expensive ) , and image stabilization . if that 's what you want , the canon 30d with the ef-s 17-55 mm f / 2.8 is will not disappoint you
1629,i watched this on masterpiece theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book . the characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you do n't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny , droning music .
1630,i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of s$# ! ? * &%# ! #$ ! there are a couple good ones , but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d , not even at a used price.i ca n't believe they did'nt put " low rider " on the soundtrack , how cheap is that
1631,i got a hold of a windows vista ultimate disk . it gave the choice to install home basic , home premium , business , or ultimate . i installed vista home basic , because i only have 512 mb of ram . likes : i like the new wallpapers and the way it looks . my documents and my music folder remind me of itunes . dislikes : do n't like that my less than 6 month old hp printer does n't work with vista and my usb net link cable does n't work with vista . when you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it . it 's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue . verdict : i like it , but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with xp . i would n't buy home basic . if you really want vista , buy a new computer with vista preinstalled or install a trial version of vista to make sure everything works . i 'm going back to xp , until hp releases vista drivers for my printer . i 'll write reviews on home premium , business , and / or ultimate if i ever get more ram . my computer 2.8 ghz pentium d 512 mb ram 128 mb video car
1632,remember the days when we were punks and we 'd gather ' round the phonograph and listen to some puccini on the old edison cylinders ? they held up to 4 minutes of music ! count ' em , 4 minutes ! then that hippie opera singer enrico caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him , including myself . he was quite the singer . when i was a young kid though , the only form of music we had were the concerts . i remember seeing franz liszt play the piano in concert , quite an amazing virtuoso , and johann strauss jr. conducting his orchestra , those were the days . then they came out with those things called grammophones , which were even more modern , if it was even possible . but it was , because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to , lazy kids . i mean , you did n't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones . and what 's this , 1 hour , a full 60 minutes of music , on 1 record ? pshaw ! 4 minutes of music was all i needed , and i was still pooped out even after that . in my day , it was bed at 4 p.m. , breakfast at 2 a.m. , then off to the mines . we did n't have 60 minutes of free time . i have no idea what form of music they have now . appearently , they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph . now all i see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods ( ? ) and mp3 , mp4 players , whatever they 're called , listening to that " hip-hop " tomfoolery of theirs . you ca n't even call it music , it 's just noise . well , gotta get ready for bed now , it 's almost 3:45
1633,over the years , i have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and i never liked using any of them . i recently bought a new set which i had to return due to the fact that i had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls , they would immediately fall out of my hair....scream ! i bought the remmington #1080n wax core roller set and i have finally found the easiest and quickest way to curl my hair . the rollers surface , when warm , grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair . the rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair . once heated , the rollers are relatively cool to the touch ( no more burned fingers ) but due to the wax core , the rollers hold plenty of heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent , long lasting results . the set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up . i 've found the warm up time takes longer than the time i actually leave the curlers in my hair . this is the best curler set i have ever used . if i was to ask for one change , it would be a quicker warm up time . however , just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy , makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation . i 'm hard to please , so my recommendation says alot . thanks remmington ( i still do n't like your other regular rollers ! ha )
1634,the slick stylish spanish thriller " nobody knows anybody " is set in seville during holy week in the year 2000. newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would-be writer simon cardenas ( eduardo noriega ) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word " adversary " as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue . since the message also contained threats , simon does what he 's told , and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events . directed by mateo gil , " nobody knows anything " opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a crucifix through his heart , and this scene is one of the ideas that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror film with religious overtones , but the plot moves away from the horror aspect into straight thriller territory . the film- -which owes much of its style to american thrillers- -is slickly produced , and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of seville help , but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed and feeling a bit cheated by the experience . i was intrigued at first by the film and drawn into the plot . however , once the plot and the mystery aspect became clear ( and i ca n't give away too much here ) , the film became silly and trite . there 's little character development- -our hero is a flat , dull passive character , and the film 's emphasis is on the thrill aspect . a slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous , this film is in spanish with english subtitles- -displacedhuma
1635,i bought this lens for my canon powershot g5 , and because it requires the use of a long adapter , not only does it cause terrible vignetting ( that circle the other poster thought was cool , but which is actually a design flaw ) unless you zoom most of the way , it blocks the built-in flash . i have owned four canon cameras over the past 15 years , and the g5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment . ( i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses , but it did n't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane for a $1000 camera body ) . ) i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon . when i 've got the money i 'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses , and selling my entire powershot kit . if you are an experienced photographer , you will not like this system at all
1636,i saw this show on logo . boy i loved it . i wish i was there
1637,if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint , this is a great value . before , you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price ( full retail $150 now ) . office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for $175 plus . this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn . also , do n't worry about file formats . you can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office .
1638,grew up watching have gun will travel . very pleased to have it out on a dvd format . watched the first season and am very pleased . bought season 2 and season 3 also . anxiously awaiting 4 , 5 , and 6
1639,the pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell - - what are these " packaging engineers " thinking ? it took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it , and then i took the scissors to it , and the hard packaging almost broke them ! but i was thrilled . a handsome object , thought i , and i loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open . so much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband . i yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions as they were written . " press and hold the set button . hour display blinking . " ( could they not have said , " the hour display will blink " ? i pressed . " press memory button to adjust the hour . " i did . the memory button never did a thing . so i asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either . we both tried several combinations of maneuvers , but nothing worked . to this moment , the hour display is blinking , blinking , blinking . i 'd like to get my money back , but ya know what ? j & r music & computer world in ny demand such a rigamarole to send it back , including with all the original packaging ( i threw the op in the trash ) , that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions , which , of course , are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves . now i 'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash , while i will make sure i never order from j&r again .
1640,i have a recently purchased acrobat 8.0 professional . it installed fine on my new vista machine , although it cites only office 2003 products . but i have ms office 2007. after installation ( and reinstallation ) no acrobat conversion options show on ms word , and when trying to use acrobat directly for an ms word file conversion it first reinstalls itself , and then reports that the word file ( i have tried several ) is corrupt . i now have to ask colleagues with older software to do my pdf conversion . i could not find out if or when adobe plans to be compatible with vista and office 2007
1641,first of all , i did not exactly ' read ' this biography . instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work ( i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way , and still been able to read many more technology related books ) . i had great expectations from this book , having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln . i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed . i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson , richard carwardine , or doris goodwin . i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography , but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character . in this context , i find mr mccullough 's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america . i also enjoy direct quotes from letters , speaches , autobiographies , as they help me refine my impressions of the context ( the period , the relationships to contemporary characters , ... ) surounding a promonent figure . usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams ' time , and i missed ' hearing ' the voice of john adams . instead , this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author . finally , having read other biographies of the founding fathers , i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin . all in all , my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions . had i known that , i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough 's fictional work
1642,this is a great beginner 's guide to home buying . the advice is straightforward and the explanations are easy to understand . buying a home is a scary and daunting prospect for me . i kept getting a lot of conflicting advice from relatives , friends , and coworkers on when to buy , what to buy , and how to buy . this is very frustrating as everyone means well , but what worked for them might not apply to me . and do n't bother asking a realtor or mortgage company if you should buy- -they make their living on our decisions to buy ! so i bought home buying for dummies to learn more , and it has a lot of sound and thoughtful guidance to help decide when and how much to buy.. . and also how to find a good home , and then negotiate with the realtors , the sellers , the mortgage companies , and everyone else that is sticking their hands in your wallet . the author 's advice is realistic , and he points out the pitfalls of jumping in and what trouble you can get into with the different loan options out there
1643,the recipes in this book are often somewhat complex , but they are easy to follow and the results are wonderful . braising does not aways take a long time either . one of my favorites is soy-braised chicken thighs with star anise and orange peel - 40 minutes total
1644,sigmund freud has done an amazing research in the field of dreams and their meanings , you will be amazed how every single detail in the dream has a meaning ( according to sigmund freud - not that i agree with him ) . and it is very impressive . personally i enjoyed this book very much
1645,i 've only used the unit 3 times , and the flip-over trimmer broke when i " flipped " it over to attach to the main clipper head . the plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head , that cracked in two , and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor . it 's very disappointing . i 'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer , i ca n't seem to find the receipt
1646,i expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read . what i did n't expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting readers . from the opening pages of the book , as wylie jones prepares to depart on a & quot ; business trip&quot ; of unspecified duration , to the penultimate chapter , when a revitalized wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on the left coast , this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the sorts of advice , hints , tips , and warnings that help to build healthy management brains in twelve ways ! think of it as a kind of business allegory . wylie 's cross-country odyssey is what might happen if robert fulghum were to meet john gardner trundling down the road on his reality bike , set fire to robertson davies ' beard , and then move on over to the highway hacienda for corn dogs and a brew with none other than warren buffet , everyone 's favorite grassroots investor . i totally loved it . it gets my absolute highest rating
1647,i agree with the people complaining about the poor cs policy at jvc . they let me down as well , when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built . i am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid jvc in the future . i just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit . this will come back and bite them in the behind
1648,this is my third digital camera and by far my favorite . i purchased after having a very versatile but large ( well large in the dimensions of digital cameras ) digital camera . i needed and wanted a camera that i could easily carry w / me at all times . this is perfect . the fugi z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access . just do n't put anything else in that pocket ! the one time i forget and did this i noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera . as with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting . i have found , however , that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so i am still able to get good interior shots if i am willing to blind people ( or my cats ) for a few seconds . the camera comes w / a docking station that i have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera . i tend to just use a usb cable direct to the computer or a really cheap usb card reader that i can attach directly to my computers usb port . i took this camera to japan and it was great . i only had one day where i ran out of battery power but that was my own fault . this is a highly recommended camera by me
1649,a must have for anybody interested in golf course architecture . as great as pebble beach is today , you 'll wonder why it was ever changed after seeing the old photos of it following chandler egan 's work in 1929 ! buy this beautiful book and you wo n't be disappointed
1650,this video is awsome if you dont like this video then you ca n't be t true pantera fan . it doesnt get any better than this except for live . watch it go ! ! !
1651,i do n't know how this skunk got 4 and 1 / 2 stars on amazon let alone one ! i could hear hepburn , bogart and holden rolling over with a resounding boom . i think this is mainly because of ford 's linus . he is a very unsympathetic character in this remake . the film critics said that , while the original sabrina was about her transformation , this version was about linus ' transformation . but here linus shows no transformation that you can really see . his explanation to sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end - " there was a merger , and you were in the way . no hard feelings " is very cold compared with bogart 's " would you believe i enjoyed every minute of it ? " in the original , you get the feeling that sabrina gets the right man ; you do n't get that here at all
1652,i ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who 's who of public school using this format . nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a christian book , espousing christian dogma and assumptions . i 'm surprised this is acceptable for use by government funded public schools . furthermore , there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition . i 'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising . some of the parenting tips are common sense that i did n't think needed to be reiterated . a person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down . i was looking for more than that . the advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation , how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process . there is false logic in some of the parental mistakes . an example is always attributing " hovering parents " to ego issues , that a parent " needs to be needed " . some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and ca n't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger . false assumptions leads to false conclusions . i gave this 2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense . but it is n't helping my family .
1653,i 'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation / backpacking pictures . the p3 was the fourth point and shoot nikon camera my family has owned . one of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it . on the p3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on . i accidently dropped it from about 30 " off the ground when it was only a few days old . it landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens . the outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus . i sent it back to nikon and as i expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty . they charged $162.50 to fix it . mastercard has a program called " purchase assurance " that will hopefully cover the repair cost ! the other night i saw a commercial on tv for an olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet , get wet , or even frozen down to 14 degrees f and still take pictures . i wish i had seen that ad first . the nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera . not buying nikon anymore .
1654,this software is " one time use " ! if you have a notebook and laptop , you wo n't be able to install for both ! it sucks
1655,the movies of course are dated , but fascinating also . the picture quality was excellent as was the sound . the main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed . now even the simplest movie , regardless of the subject has an edge . these " horror " movies of the 40s-50s are gentler , less scary , with a clear statement of good and evil . now we view things differently without any absolute judgments . clarity has given way to a more unsettled world
1656,flynn offers up a fast-paced , if unbelievable story . unfortunately , character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences . characters , like rapp , with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles , have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the " real world " works . meanwhile , flynn 's politicians ( the majority of whom are democrats ) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election . while there are grains of truth in his characters , flynn consistently goes for the cheap , partisan stereotype . i was looking for a well-developed political / military thriller . i 'm still looking .
1657,king elvis . queen madiona . prince justin . and now princess hillary ! duff is slowly making her way up to the queen of pop . it was espicially nice to here my teen idol singing all christmas classics with some other pop stars too . if you love hillary duff and you really need some new cd 's by her and it 's crhistmas time then this is cd for you ! let me tell ya somethin ' , that girl can sing . so go to the cd store . buy it ! play it ! plop down on the couch and have a glass of egg nog .
1658,this era of tangerine dream ( td ) was just great . the virgin years were truly a great period for td . for me it deals with space and landscape . it 's so close to repetitive music that would come much later . it 's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies . you could fly with them and end up with more in the end . you ca n't say that for too many of these electronic groups . after that period they would go on with this ambient music that was n't up to the same standards . it seems they are back ( with other musicians of course ) with the same kind of concept . great ! they were an important link on the electronic scene . a great album ! a great period
1659,i had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7. even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs . i can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes . this reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document . for these reasons i 'm quite satisfied with the purchase
1660,the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use . they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on . the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me . every head is different , so maybe they 'll work better for you
1661,i paid extra for air next day service . item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately . item eventually arrived two weeks later . i had left for a trip . item was eventually sent back to merchant . merchant did n't credit me for item returned . i had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited . i wo n't buy from willoughby 's again
1662,these are the same tracks from totally buble which was released without buble 's consent . " totally buble " is not an album that i wanted to be released . they were songs i recorded for a film called " totally blonde " many years ago before i was signed to 143 / reprise records . the decision to release it as an album was made by the film 's producer , and i had no control over stopping him . it is important for everyone to know , that i only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and i sincerely apologize if you purchased this album . " - michael buble
1663,a film that 's a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism . since nothing is as it seems , we may as well be inside a fictionalized world ; like the unicorn story the main character , cathryn , is writing . this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding , is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination ; however , the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring . a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem ( hugh is played by rene , rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh . cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn ) . insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind , but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever-changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside . a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action , another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance
1664,my daughter and another second-grade friend both got bored of this game after 20 minutes of staring at a horse standing in a stall and listening to a cat meow . the controls are not very logical , and there is no animation to speak of
1665,the more i listen to this album , the more i love it . what 's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at first becomes totally captivating on further listening . like a girl you thought was nothing special at first glance but then becomes beautiful as you get to know the complete package . this is one cooooool cd .
1666,lcd fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker was n't stong enough . anyhow , i could push it back . then , the scale could n't be turned on by tapping on the top . this is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual . i have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime ! i think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken . this is the problem i ca n't fix . the only thing i can do is sending it back . following up : according to the other review , i tried to make this scale " vibrating " using different ways of tapping . it did n't work no matter how hard i tried . i had to use my toe to lift up one side a little ( about half an inch ) and drop it on hard floor to make enough " vibration " to turn it on . i wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on . my soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping . i have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate . just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass . and also , be careful to use it in bathroom : moisture will make the glass surface slippery .
1667,i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera . followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail . it appears that this remote is defective
1668,charles h . kahn 's account of the pythagorean philosophical tradtion , although less than 200 pages long , is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality . in a concise , but intelligent , summary , kahn traces pythagoreanism from its semi-legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as copernicus and kepler . as a young academic who specialises in the pythagorean tradition i can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars , but as a latinist i must say i was disapointed by kahn 's treatment ( or lack of ) of this strand of western philosophy in late roman and medieval thought . but , this is still the best up to date history of pythagoreanism available in the english language
1669,for the price and quality i rated this lenses with 5 stars . if you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos i took in europe . i too around 5000 photos . i posted a few on the web ( see link below ) . for the price i recommend this lens as walk around lens . the zoom is pretty usefull they are very realiable and ( almost ) very sharp . get this lens instead of the kit lens ( 18-55 mm ) until you are ready to spend more . here are some of my pictures taken in europe with this lens ( images have been compressed ) : http : / / www.laplazita.net / europa /
1670,alec baldwin is tied with john goodman for the second highest appearing host of all time . so it 's only natural that he now has a best of dvd . this is not the best snl dvd , but it is still a very good one . if you already have the best of dana carvey , mike myers , steve martin , and tom hanks.. . get this one next . this dvd has a couple of not-so-good skits , but it makes up for every one . there are a lot of hilarious skits on the dvd . i 'm not going to list them , but just trust me . anyone who gives this less than four stars is out of their mind . when i first saw that the best of alec baldwin was out i didn ; t have to give it a second thought . it was at the top of my list , and it should be at the top of yours too .
1671,even though amanda is quite attractive , the camera work is bad , the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga dvd a bitter disappointment . there are few close-ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window . a bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better . if you are looking for an accidentally soft focus dvd of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost , this is for you
1672,the satinelle ice epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do : remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root . what an advantage ! hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving , and when it does , it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving . i do n't think it hurts much , though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others . the trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily . i am very happy with this product
1673,i lovelovelove dark chocolate , ( and other strong , pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer ) but these taste just plain wierd . it 's not terrible , but i can taste the hoodia , sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate . i think they work at reducing hunger , but they give me gas so bad i ca n't be sure if i want to eat less because of the hoodia , or the gas . maybe i 'll try the *regular* chocoleans , but i wo n't be buying this again . fyi : i absolutely love the phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix . i have no problems with that . tastes great , works great . and no gas !
1674,very possibly the worst cd i have ever heard in my life . i could barely force myself to listen until the last song was blissfully over . this is not music . it is stupid noise !
1675,the book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting . however , the author included a lot of details that just really did n't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts . the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book . my professor was able to bring dr. schrag to talk to our class . he was a good lecturer-keeping the class ' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro . if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style , i think he would have much more success as an author
1676,the " drummer " ( more like " the anti-drummer " ) on this is johnny cresci . he is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability , and literally has no idea what a 6 / 8 blues meter is . how he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time . for me , mr. " clueless " cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like driving an aston martin with a flat tire ! i have tried to get beyond cresci 's chops for over a year of listening now , and i simply ca n't do it . if you 're a musician , his playing will make you extremely agitated . i 'm gonna have to trade this in , and go on listening to live adventures like i have for the past 37 years . this would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6 / 8 numbers . granted , this is an historically significant release , but i think it should have stayed in the vault , or released with johnny cresci having been digitally removed or replaced
1677,i had a horrible cold , felt like complete #### but i had to work . this little two ounce vitamin b shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and i was able to get some work done . there really is no crash and the taste is n't that bad . ..it tastes like a melted freeze pop . note : it may give you the jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach
1678,it is n't very user friendly . i have other software that is much easier ( adobe photo shop ) . this one will take some time and effort to get used to and work with .
1679,the camera came with no memory chip . the online store had no more of this camera or chips so the only thing they could suggest was to return it for a refund . not a great experience
1680,i thought the video was well done . it was good to feature the clinching games of the division and league championship series plus all four games of the world sries . i think they should have included at least the high - lights on a extra disk of games 1 and 2 of the division series against boston and games 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of the league championship series against los angeles . still , i highly recommend this collection for all gung-ho white sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88 years . a great viewing companion for those cold winter nights
1681,roger caras , a very talented writer and animal lover , takes us on a tour of thistle hill , his farm in northern maryland . anyone who loves cats , dogs and other animals will love this book . its gentle humor and compassion are quite absorbing . i must confess to a certain amount of jealousy , though- -i would love to have a home like thistle hill farm
1682,my subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew . they are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software . 2005 works fine until i have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support . i wo n't pay for their telephone customer support , trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this . shame on you pcillin
1683,after 25 years of building pc , and installing software , beta testing software , i am unable , even with adobe 's technical support staff to install acrobat version 8. software gets to the end of the install process and stalls . no combination of repair , uninstall , reinstall , registry cleaning , advice from three technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem . using xp , with all the latest upgrades , defragging the drives , with 2 mb ram , and a adobe tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software .
1684,i bought omnipage 15 yesterday morning as a download , and have been trying to activate it ever since . after several calls to customer service , forty minutes on hold to speak with a tech rep ( who emailed me two links that do n't open ) , i 'm no closer to being able to use this program . it seemed to work okay in the few intro uses allowed before you had to activate to continue , but even then it kept wanting to reload with every page i scanned in . the product might be a good one- -i 'm not a fair judge of that- -if only you can get it to work . as others have pointed out , tech support is expensive . if my experience is any measure , it 's also worthless . customer service is unresponsive , unpleasant , and unprofessional . in one call to customer service , i was asked if i typed the letters in the serial number as capitals and the o 's as zeroes . when assured that i had , several times , she replied , " then i ca n't help you- -call the tech department , " and abruptly hung up . to add irritation to insult , in the forty minutes i was on hold with the tech department , i listened to repeated assurances that a " reepersentative " would be with me shortly . not recommended .
1685,i bought this because it was 50% off . i ca n't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer . i guess for background noise , it would be good but as a photo viewer , it 's not . small screen + low resolution = poor viewer
1686,the late carl sagan was one of the most popular , influential , and successful interpreters of astronomy to the american public . in 1973 he published & quot ; the cosmic connection&quot ; . he offered a daring view of the universe and his seminal work became a classic of popular science , inspiring a generation of scientists and non-specialist general readers with an enthusiasm for all aspects of science in general , and astronomy in particular . now cambridge university press has reissued a new edition of sagan 's influential book , enhanced with freeman dyson 's commentary on sagan 's vision and on the importance of & quot ; the cosmic connection&quot ; ; ann dryan 's assessment of sagan 's cultural significance as a champion of science ; and david morrison 's discussion of the advances made over the past 30 years and what became of sagan 's predictions . carl sagan 's cosmic connection is & quot ; must&quot ; reading for all sagan fans and anyone interested in how his views and predictions have held up over the past three decades of rapid advances in the science of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence
1687,i bought this program because i wanted to use it on the pocket pc ( dell axim x50v ) . the program is very confusing to use . it took some time to load on the ppc first , then you have to load the maps . i tried to load the map of the whole state and it was n't working . the map would come up and the gps reciever would pick up where i was , but when i would write an address of a street that exists , it would say " search done , no match found . " i called the delorme support many times , they helped me go through the application , but i feel that this application wont give me directions that i want off of the ppc . i should have bought the iguidance . one of my friends has this application and it is awesome . he loaded 3 states all at once and it gives you directions very easily . there are many points of interest . i particularly like the screen that shows you all the streets in a 3d fashion . it is easy to use . " do n't make the mistake that i made , buy the iguidance or tomtom software . "
1688,the music on this album is performed so exquisitely ; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating , that one is almost tempted to forget what a " what for ? " musical this is . donna murphy plays the title character of fosca , a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky . she lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome , virile giorgio . giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful , but vapid clara , a married woman back home . however from the time giorgio comes into fosca 's sphere , she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him . she shows up everywhere he happens to be ; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity . to depict fosca musically , sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career . everything is so lugubrious , dark , portentous , tragic ; punctuated by militaristic strains ( with snare drums ) because the soldiers like to...umm...march . in the end , giorgio is worn down enough by fosca 's attentions that he succumbs . he believes he has fallen in love with her , shortly after which she...dies . as i mentioned earlier , the material is beautifully performed ( marin mazzie and jere shea render the opening " happiness " with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality . donna murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting " loving you . " ) , but you come away wondering what the point of it all is . if sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease , then he succeeds admirably
1689,this movie was the first dvd i ever bought ! it is truly a gem . i like the infinifilm bonus features . ( it may not have been called infinifilm at this time . ) brett ratner is truly a comedic genius , and really gives the customer great quality dvd's . the movie is funny and interesting enough . i enjoyed the scenes in several different locales . i enjoyed the physical interactions between jackie and chris tucker . i think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated . jackie chan is a genius at physical comedy . i highly recommend this dvd . two thumbs up ! ! ! mc white said : check it out ! ! !
1690,i ca n't even comment on the actual system works application because i never got it to run - it ruined my system right after install ! once i installed it , it asked for a reboot , then came back wtih " load error ! press a key to reboot.. . " which just lead to the error message again , and again , and again . a chat with tech support ( after an hour wait ) revealed that there are problems with the goback files , so i had to create a bootable cd , and do all kind of things which i have n't been able to do yet since my burner software does n't have image capability - necessary for creating this bootable cd . do n't buy it , do n't install it , do n't use it - uninstall everything norton / symantec and never go back . i 'll be lucky if i ever get my computer working again.....thanks symantec ! ! ! !
1691,this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . here 's why : 1. the objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . i suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . the planets will appear as very small disks . one will be able to see saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc. 2. the mount is an altazimuth , which will not follow the celestial object in the sky . the earth is rotating , and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision . a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects . 3. the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . the observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 4. the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to " shiver " , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . save your money for a larger scope with a better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf
1692,unfortunately i had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a mac 10.4 program ( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a mac .
1693,this bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true . what is also true is that is contains more fat . what you will notice with the first bite , is that the bar seems somehow " inflated " . there is an emptiness to consistency of the bar . you are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a myoplex or apex bar . stick with those brands for pure nutrition and far better taste . these metrx bars leave you feeling as though you 've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert , yet these will not be mistaken for desserts
1694,i received one of these towels as a gift several years ago . it was , by far , one of the best gifts i have ever received ! it soaks all of the water out of your hair and leaves it perfect for blow drying . for women , this is a five star gift
1695,this is quite a sharp turn from francine 's previous album ( 40 on a fall day ) ... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble 's work in poundcake , this time around it 's quieter , subtler , sweeter and sadder . make no mistake , this is a break-up album . even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold , lonely , hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can . the mood will draw you in and keep you listening , but after a few listens it 's the songs you 'll fall in love with . ahh , the songs . they 're densely packed with chord changes , odd but appealing lyrics , and unexpected instrumentation . they 're hooky without being obvious ( a francine specialty ) . this was my favourite album of 2003 , and i still listen to it pretty often these days . best tracks : this sunday 's revival , silver plated 606 , novelty , 13 years . best lyric : " read a year old mail / now you should 've told me / i 've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly
1696,blues singers should n't try to go mainstream . if they do try and succeed , fine . that means they 've stayed true to their roots . when they try and fail ( as susan has done with hope and desire ) , one would hope they 'd try to get back to where they started . for me that was just wo n't burn . i guess when one is happily married with children , it 's hard to sing the blues since you 're not feeling them . . . you 're faking them
1697,awhile ago i was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste , such as people who love r&b and rap to people who prefer dance . in a way , texas chainsaw massacre , as well as the exorcist and the shining are like the beatles and led zeppelin of horror movies : you must love them and say anything different and you 're going to get lynched . so i will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so-called " horror movies " , yet at the same time i wonder why it did n't hit me that much . 5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses . they decide to check it out only no one 's home...seemingly at first . pretty soon they meet leatherface , a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw . pretty soon , the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive . it 's odd how i ca n't say any more about the plot ; not because of spoilers but because there 's not a lot else to say . like many a filmgoer , i ca n't stand the latest releases in horror . instead of using atmosphere , pacing and mood to creep people out , they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes . this film is n't even gory at all . in fact , the film 's goriest scene , where one of the kids meets a chainsaw , is n't even shown onscreen . your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing . adding to the realism is that it 's shot in a kind of documentary-like style . one problem i had with the film was that the dread did n't feel there . there was pre-mtv style editing and extreme-closeups of eyeballs and maybe i 've just seen it before but it did n't creep me out like it should 've ( and having a woman scream for 20 minutes does n't help ) . if i saw this in 1974 , i mostly likely would 've been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later , it 's more like " yeah it was alright although i better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it " . if you 're a fan , go ahead and buy it because it 's probably the best release of the film but personally , i 'm not
1698,this dryer works great but it gets pretty hot . watch your ears and fingertips
1699,explodes upon the crime-detective scene . the hundreth man , his first book was excellent and the death collectors is as good and even better . ca n't wait for the next one ! why this is an amazon sale item befuddles me . but since it is , grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel ! the psit team of lapd , carson ryder and harry nautilus are faced with a dual-time mystery . more than 30 years in the past , a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him , is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced . and now ; starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room...it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror . each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of carson and harry . the touch of subtle humor adds bas-relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time.perfect ! the murders are freakish ! disgusting ! brutal ! but the two psit detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old / new mystery will knock you out of your chair . a truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic ' partners against crime' . a series to follow and enjoy . get both of kerley 's books and double your pleasure ! try them , you 'll like them and you 'll love jack kerley . i promise ! !
1700,i am a howard stern fanatic and a softball fanantic . i could n't go wrong with this movie , right ? wrong ! it is pretty bad . i was disappointed with artie 's project . gross jokes terrible acting . there are a couple of funny scenes . wait until it is on sale
1701,after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar , i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc . was n't worth the effort , i 'm afraid . velveeta on wonder bread-dull collection of acid jazz duds . not bad as background noise for your next dinner party , but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act . a pass for all but galactic completeists , if such an animal exists
1702,i bought this shaver last september , and at that point i agreed with the other reviewers . it delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use . this past may , it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely . i only used the recommended cleaning solution , changed it according to the instructions , and cleaned it after every use . i sent the shaver back to remington , they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks . it worked wonderfully , for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again ! i 'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time , it is n't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver !
1703,okay for the time being but not enough . needs to be combined with system mechanic for optimum capacit
1704,simple and great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user . i would say it is the beginner to intermediate user tool . i can really create fast movies very quickly . pros : easy to install easy to split / edit home videos compatible with ilink support for high definition hdv camcorders competitive price cons : user interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows . rendering is slow .
1705,i started off using turbotax this year , but returned it to the store to use taxcut instead . i purchased this version because it was a bargain , and it 's easy enough to do state taxes by hand ( or for free on the state website for those states that have that option ) . i did have some difficulty with the update process , which was frustrating at first . however , i found taxcut 's website to be helpful on this point , and i determined that my firewall was the problem . i was able to update the product once i followed their instructions . one key difference between turbotax and taxcut was that taxcut is not integrated with as many companies . whereas i could automatically download my w-2 and most of my 1099 forms into turbotax , they needed to be manually entered with taxcut . this was n't a huge issue , but one difference people might want to know . i completed and e-filed multiple federal returns , which worked great , and the e-file charge was reasonable ( $15.95 ) . however , i do n't suggest having the e-file charge taken out of your refund . apparently , there 's an extra charge ( i think $25 ) for this service . it 's more efficient and less expensive to just pay the fee with a credit card . now to the software itself . i found it easy to navigate and enter information . i was a bit disappointed in the deduction section . many of the fields were too short for me to enter complete names and addresses of charities , which i found frustrating . however , the calculations were accurate . i checked taxcut 's calculations regarding amt , and they were excellent ( turbotax 's calculations were wrong ) . in the second return i completed , the taxpayer was eligible for eic , and taxcut accurately identified this and did the proper calculations here as well . overall , i was very satisfied with the product , and will use it again next year . i will make suggestions to taxcut , and hope they will improve their support for automatic download of forms and longer fields for charitable deductions . however , even without these changes , the product is an exceptional value
1706,babyliss pro instant heat 5 jumbo roller hairsetter comes in a compact , useful size . however , the rollers take a long time to heat up . even if left plugged in for a half-hour , they do not reach a high enough temperature to effectively curl thick hair . i would not recommend this product
1707,apparently the difference between a criminal act ( theft ) and moral redistribution of income is 1 ) who you steal from ( stealing from the wealthy , of course , is moral - - according to rawls and bolsheviks ) , and 2 ) who receives the loot ( the non-wealthy makes it moral ) , and 3 ) who commits the act ( the state / society , of course also makes theft moral ; example - taxation ) , and 4 ) your intentions ( redistribution of income ) . to look at this another way , if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money , that 's a crime ( unless your neighbor is poor - - which would then be moral and justice , according to rawls ' formula ) . if the community comes into your house and steals from you , it 's legal and moral justice , again , according to rawls . because , according to rawls , if , before you were born , you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured , you 'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal , or they would be compensated somehow for being born ( unjustly ) less-equal . how ? by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more . so those with more would be like oh , say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less . so those with more would become a resource , or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because " society " ( the robin hoods and rawls of the world ) deemed this as moral justice . rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk , entrepreneurs , students of life who work to earn an " a " vs. students who earn an " f " . he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own . true . but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause , nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference . forcing the " wealthier " ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill is n't justice or moral . it would simply be an unjust law . some people see rawls ' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia ( like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism ) . i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery , and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit . in a sense , this book is an argument against the individual . it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people - - he does n't recognize any individuals ( unless they were born as victims ) . curious . how do you experience life ... as a group-mind ( an oxymoron if there ever was one ) , a collective ? or as a unique , isolated , independent , individual ? there should be societal incentives to help each other . okay . but when it is forced ( theft of property always implies force ) , it is no longer an issue of morality or justice - - it 's simply a law . without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue , by definition . transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom ?
1708,published in 1986 , dr. deming " out of the crisis " seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in american management mentality . two main subjects are discussed in the book . the first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations , the second , relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way american management operates . 14 core points are suggested by dr. deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods . throughout the book , dr. deming promotes the loss of slogans that are even today being practiced by a share of the american industry , and advocates management that is based on principles such as quality and leadership . at times , the book is not a continuous process that is easy to follow , but overall , dr. deming 's concepts are transferred to the reader . dr. deming 's " out of the crisis " helped me learn new perspectives about how management and employees can help in building or transforming an industry to a successful one .
1709,following on from the fantastic ' the duel ' allison moorer 's latest release ' getting somewhere ' is a massive , massive disappointment . quite simply the material on ' getting somewhere ' is weak and gutless . on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of ' the duel ' - such as on hallelujah & new years day - earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish , pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long , hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing rs field next time around . if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job . moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre ( she can write a mean song too ! ) . this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately
1710,trace adkins has set them up and knocked them down once more ! can trace ever produce any music that sounds bad ? his low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from his dog to his woman to his god ! i strongly recommend that everyone has trace 's latest cd in their collection ! a big ten-four in my cd player
1711,as far as gps software goes , there is nothing better available than streets & trips and autoroute . there are dozens of features that you ca n't find with the self-contained gps units . it is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order , night-view is another great feature , as are the topographical maps . the new feature offered this year , of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map , is also a welcome addition . the only reason i 'm giving it a four is because of the following : 1 ) there is still no ground-level or 3d view of the roads for use in the gps function 2 ) they still have n't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them . 3 ) there is n't a lot of coverage for eastern european countries , most notably , nothing in russia . nonetheless , it is still better than any other gps software on the market
1712,other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping , the battery itself in a good deal . they work well , charge up easy and hold their charge nicely . priced well , they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony . i bought them for a d80 and the older en-el3a would not fit . of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80. basically the same size and shape , but keyed differently . i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s , meaning they are backward compatable .
1713,kate moss ? that gawddamn rollerskate song ? oh , no . the spoken tracks are equally repelling . there is really no atmosphere to this album
1714,for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his / her dirty secrets covered up . i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released . it hides the fact that we as citizens , and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office . if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up . i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time , and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either . i feel that it comes down to the man , and if he does have the values his / her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing , and own up to his / her mistake . this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up , and there are no absolutes , or rights or wrongs . wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich ? do we wait until then to change the moral ? that 's pathetic , and so is this movie
1715,tim russert is a great journalist and this book is a great resource for ideas and suggestions on how to be a better dad . in fact there is something in this book for everyone no matter what your relationship with your father is or was . the most precious things a father can provide are time , attention , and love . this book makes the reader sit back and appreciate the little things only you and your dad know . great work ! keep it up , tim ! - - i also watch most of tim 's tv programs .
1716,this movie captures faithfully what is in my imagination when i read the book . even though it was made several years ago , it 's still a fantastic movie . timeless
1717,very nice scale , worked wonderfully for a family member of mine with poor eyesigh
1718,i got the fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so i decided to give it a try . at first it seemed ok , but i started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my mach 3 turbo . i decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a mach 3 turbo and the other half with the fusion . from my experience , the mach 3 turbo gave a closer shave , and glided much smoother across my skin than the fusion . i think the 5 blades on the fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else . and as cool as the single trimming blade is , it seems like gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades . in other words , the single blade is a fix rather than a feature . my call is if your using a mach 3 turbo , do n't waste your money on the fusion
1719,rosetta stone spanish is the third major spanish course that i am buying . i have comtpleted all of the spanish lessons in the pimsleur series , and have also completed learning spanish like crazy level one and two . i am one of those rare latinas that did not learn spanish from my parents . my mexican parents felt that it would be easier to " assimilate " if i only spoke english . after going to my grandparents ' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak spanish , and after having latino strangers speak to me in spanish and then look at me in astonishment when i struggled just to say " no , hablo espanol , " i felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language . the first course that i used was pimsleur spanish . compared to rosetta stone i must say that i learned much more vocabulary with the rosetta stone software . but i recommend pimsleur over rosetta stone , especially for the complete beginner . because of its easy teaching method , in my opinion pimsleur is even better than lslc for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking spanish . pimsluer goes at a very slow pace . but if you have already learned some spanish on your own or in high school or college , then you can probably skip pismleur and go straight to lslc . or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you 'll probably want to go with learning spanish like crazy . lslc covers a lot more spanish words and grammar than pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace . so where does rosetta stone fit in ? i would say use rosetta stone after you have completed the above courses . it is difficult to really learn how to speak spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear . you never really learn how to think in spanish and create your own sentences . so why am i still giving it 4 stars ? because if you already know how to speak some spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more spanish words to your vocabulary by using the rosetta stone software . one negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software 's interface is " antiquated " with photos from the 1980s . and the sound quality is not as clear as pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy . but if you stick it out through the drudgery , you will be surprised with how many spanish words you learned with this software . but i think pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing . and by teaching me concepts , i have really retained the material and by understanding concepts , i am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences . something that i would not have been able to do if i had used this course alone . another negative about this course , is that unlike the other two courses that i mentioned , you have to use rosetta stone while sitting in a computer . that is difficult for me because i am very busy with classes , work and my personal life . i can use pimsleur or lslc on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer . besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method , the only downside of pimsleur is that it does not teach the same spanish words that are most commonly used by mexicans and other latinos in regular conversation . pimsleur spanish is very formal spanish . we say " mucho gusto " like lslc teaches , pimsleur teaches " encantado . " and in our overly " macho " culture if a man responds with " encantado " many latinos may get the wrong impression about him . it is not something that i am proud to say about my ( latino ) culture , but it is true . and pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say " encantado " to some latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker . learning spanish like crazy has taught me useful practical spanish that i can use to communicate with my spanish speaking friends and family . when i tell people that i learned to speak spanish as an adult and not at home as a child , many of them do not believe me . i think they find it incredible for two reasons : one , my accent really sounds like a native speaker from using lslc . two , i have learned real conversational spanish from lslc . i have learned words and phrases that spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other . pimsleur taught me spanish that the author of the course thought that i should speak , not the spanish that latinos really speak . that is one of the positive things that separates lslc course from the others . so in what order would i rate the three in terms of ease of teaching method : 1. pimsleur spanish 2. learning spanish like crazy 3. rosetta stone spanish but in terms of teaching real conversational spanish and teaching a real latin american accent , i rate them as follows : 1. learning spanish like crazy 2. pimsleur spanish 3. rosetta stone spanish
1720,i purchased the 8 x 10 photo frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter . i was able to get the product running and to load a ' test ' set of pictures , but the product then ' froze ' at the startup screen . i checked the pacific digital support website , which provided steps ( basically , a sequence of buttons to hold down ) to ' unfreeze ' and reinitialize the unit . i tried this sequence several times , to no avail , and then called pacific digital customer service . after repeated messages left on a voice mail system ( " we 're sorry we missed your call - we 'll get back to you " ) at all times of the day and night , i was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned . long story short - our wedding came and went , the problem was never ( and will apparently never be ) resolved , and the digital photo frame is now a $390 paperweight . absolutely useless . my recommendation : do not purchase a pacific digital product . this is clearly a fly-by-night outfit
1721,i have used intuit products since 1992 , and was quite satisfied until 4 years ago when intuit began installing hidden software on users ' computers in an attempt to " stop piracy " , which caused numerous problems for us honest users who paid for the program . secondly and even more significantly , i began noticing an apparent shift in intuit 's philosophy toward it 's customers : cut back on customer support , and attempt to exploit them at every possible opportunity in order to make more money . in short , intuit disrespects their customers . as a loyal paying customer , i will not be disrespected or taken for granted . their level of service and support has declined . their products constantly pimp you to spend more money on intuit as you try to use their programs . that is why i have sworn off intuit products when there is an alternative . why reward someone who treats you badly ?
1722,i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling . while reh was first and foremost a story teller , pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather 's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades . this , as previous reviewers have mentioned , creates a large gap between reader and story . but why do this ? why use such a crappy method of story telling ? i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue . all in all , it 's a slow , uninspired , day dream story . so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews . i want my money back
1723,i loved this book . the food was really good and fast ( which is good because i have a very packed schedule ) . also great if you 're on a budget . the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants . the only reason it did n't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy ( i 'm from texas , i like spicy ) , to the point my boyfriend could n't eat it . i just modified the recipes and everything was fine
1724,it 's good as my title says , however , i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off
1725,i 'm by no means an expert , but i really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price . i did a ton of research and landed on the ag-dvc30 after much agonizing over " to hd or not hd " as well as brands and features . based on all the reviews i read , this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money . i have not been disappointed . on my first outing , i took the cam to the grand canyon and sedona . wow ! what incredible color and clarity ! i also really love the 16x zoom . it 's smooth and powerful . i got great shots of the colorado river from the rim of the grand canyon . i 'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great . it is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject . if you 're interested in good audio , i 'd suggest an optional mic . if you just want great video , awesome color , and ease of use , this is your camera . at the price ( plus the rebate ) you really ca n't beat it
1726,chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again . fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions . nicks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older ' pop ' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days...no , we 're not saying recycle the older productions , but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and ' originality ' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey , it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes , how the mighty have fallen.. . oh brother. .
1727,this is absolutely the worse digital device i have ever owned . the manual is worthless and the web site even worse . i try to delete the included photos , and nothing happens . i ca n't download photos from my mac . if your digital memory card has many photos , good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame .
1728,if you liked the original clerks soundtrack , then you 're sure to love this . thirteen years after we heard randall and dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first clerks soundtrack , now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is , in fact , the real trilogy . and we , the clerks fans , get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track . oh , and did i mention the music ? terrific ! kevin smith 's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie . it 's not too difficult to imagine that kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time . in typical kevin smith fashion , the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises . you 've got your typical soul asylum and alanis morrisette as well as king diamond and an unexpected jackson 5 dance number . if you have not seen the movie , please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack . doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them . overall , a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any clerks fan .
1729,i had originally heard " drive away " on a radio station and i was instantly blown away . upon seeing the music video for it , i decided to buy the cd . i was hardly disappointed . the emotion that goes into the cd is amazing and it 's definitly a cd to sit down and enjoy . i saw the band in concert and met jonah after the show and was amazed by how down to earth he was . give gratitude a chance and you wo n't be disappointed .
1730,as with many of the " for dummies " series , controlling cholesterol is a well-executed overview of many issues relevant to cholesterol . author carol rinzler 's light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is , to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why " target " values for cholesterol can differ in different people . there 's an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like atkins ' , sugar busters , and protein power - - pluses and minuses of each . " ten cholesterol myths " in chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help answer many of the questions that i am asked when treating cholesterol in my patients ( in my cardiology practice ) . one criticism : like all books about cholesterol , controlling cholesterol for dummies gives the reader the impression that high cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease , as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack . this is patently untrue , but not really a criticism of this book as it is of the standard thinking on cholesterol . there are better ways ! nonetheless , this book does serve its intended purpose very well : educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding of cholesterol .
1731,ok , i was hasty in this purchase . at first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14 , shipping included . then i got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera i ordered . you see , the dimensions listed under " more details " are for the outside of the case , not the inside ( but it does n't say interior nor exterior , just gives dimensions ) . turns out , not only do you have to click " more details , " ( fine print ) you also have to click " more technical details . " ( finer print ) wish i had now . just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case . electrogalaxy will not refund shipping charges , and they charge a %20 restocking fee . so , at most , after i pay return shipping , ( the case is only $4 ) i might get back $2. so , yeah i was hasty , but i was also robbed
1732,having read this book as well as barnet schacter 's on new york during the revolution , both works i find are flawed in different ways . the likeable thing about gallagher is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the time . the hard thing to realize about the battle of brooklyn is that it really was n't much of a battle . the author here makes some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare being ushered in with the advent of this battle . if that is so then the complete defeat of washy 's army bodes ill for that development ! gallagher is on better ground when he provides a nice overall of tactics and warfare in the 18th century . he gives a good account of training and recruitment in both armies . one of the more interesting things he mentions is that due to the two-rank line used by both sides in the revolutionary war , casualties from musketry and artillery tended to be light . this is an interesting point , and one not brought out by many historians of the period . in europe stronger lines of 3 and sometimes 4 ranks were employed , which provided greater strength , but also more density . hence increased loss from fire . a point well worth considering when looking at the battles of the revolution . most historians miss this completely , or are not interested in it . gallagher provides more of a military history in general on this subject , but he does waste a lot of time with preleminaries . more than half of the book is spent providing the standard background for the causes of the revolution , etc. while certainly required for the general reader ; when a book is as short as this one is it seems almost pointless . when we get down to the battle itself gallagher gives us not much more than schacter does . the british flank march completely compromises washy 's position , the outlying forces are swept away clear and simple . the confusion of command between putnam and sullivan no doubt made a bad situation worse . washy 's complete lack of strategic perspective shows up totally here . the defense of brooklyn , much less manhatten itself was a foregoon conclusion . washy was mad to consider defending brooklyn , much less manhatten in the first place . he committed his ill-trained army to an impossible task . that he did not lose completely was due more to how the british under howe chose to wage their campaign . most american authors try to put a bright light on what is essnetially a dark canvas . at brooklyn the americans ran . period . a few units stood their ground , in particular the marylanders , but no one else really did . the reason why american losses were not greater was because they did run . some authors try to say that british losses in killed and wounded were greater than americans at this battle . this is true partly because the british had to attack some strong positions that held for a time until pireced by the assault . british losses were often greater in this regard because americans usually ran once the british bayonet began to strike home . still , of the 1 , 000+ casualities sustained by the americans here , more than most us historians care to admit fell to british musketry and bayonets . the british loss was still well below 400. as the great maurice de saxe said in his memoirs of warfare in this period , more of the enemy can usually be despatched when he runs as opposed to when he stands . to reserve fire until the enemy line breaks was considered the most effective tactic of this period . in that respect many dozens of rebels must have been shot down as they ran before british bayonets . gallagher provides some understanding why the british did not storm the heights right away . this has often been one of the major criticisms of howe 's victory . why did n't he follow up ? after marching all night to outflank the americans , the british were disorganized , and tired . they had also foght a running battle with a fleeing enemy . howe did not believe his army was in any condition to storm brooklyn heights , memory of bunker hill or no . of course this does not explain why it was not done the following day . if we look more closely at howe 's position we can perhaps explain his rationale . his commission was both a general and peacemaker . he wanted to convince the rebels to come back into the royal fold . he could best do this by showing how futile their resistence to the crown was . to have destroyed washy 's army in brooklyn would have been gratuitous , excessive . such loss of blood would have defeated the purpose in mind . in restrospect it is easy to find fault with this strategy , and it would prove to be the only chance the british really had to crush the revolution in its infancy . the battle of brooklyn needs to be looked at from several perspectives . gallagher gives us a good start , but i think a more comprehensive work still needs to address all the issues here .
1733,plain and simple...cage is one of the best underground rappers around.....and soon after hell 's winter drops i think he will be accepted into mainstream......this cd is cage at his craziest , the beats are hott , the rhymes are hot...buy this cd....and if you like this cd buy some of his other cds , weatherproof , night hawks , smut peddler 's : porn again , the leak brothers : water world , and hell 's winter
1734,gene watson 's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for sonny james , ernest tubb , and dottie west . i had never heard of him but then when i heard his voice on the cd i knew the songs . it 's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should . every song is great but the one which i really like is & quot ; the old man and his horn&quot ; . this was a song i had never heard . it also shows the versatility of gene 's song selections . he has the best voice of any country singer i have ever heard
1735,great tooth brush.my dentist said my gums and teeth have never looked bette
1736,this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks . loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit , but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous . " lies my teacher told me " could have been an amazing book , but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote , much to the dismay of my idiotic sociology professor . the only reason i did n't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good , but the book as a whole is just far too biased
1737,this live dvd was released as a companion to randy travis ' " worship & faith " cd . the concert was recorded on july 15 , 2003 at calvary assmebly god church in orlando , florida . here , travis delivers many of the songs from the w&f album , plus " pray for the fish " and his country radio hit " three wooden crosses . " comments from travis and from several fans are added in between songs . like its audio companion , this dvd contains a great mix of classic hymns , camp meeting songs and contemporary worship songs . some of the highlights include " you are worthy of my praise , " " just a closer walk with thee , " " we fall down " and " open the eyes of my heart . " other noteworthy tracks include " shall we gather at the river , " " peace in the valley , " " above all " and " love lifted me . " travis closes the show with " three wooden crosses , " the first song recorded on a christian music label to ever top the country music charts . " worship & faith " is a great dvd for lovers of worship music , lovers of country music , as well as for any and every randy travis fan . this is an excellent dvd
1738,for quite sometime lured by media publicity i thought sony a good brand . but this was not at all true for digital cameras . i bought this p73 for myself and an hp 4 mp camera for my cousin much cheaper than sony . both 3x optical zoom . the hp one was far better in image quality . main problem is that photo quality is not so good . it lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy . this fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a cannon or an hp camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions . also , in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom , say 5x or so in other brands . also during video , every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off , another irritating fact . not recommended
1739,i had never heard leonard cohen 's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers / songwriters . given his status / reputation i thought i should get this cd and learn what all the fuss was about . having had no preconceptions , i have to say i was quite disappointed . i think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable . perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best . specific example that speaks volumes : listen to cohen 's singing of his " hallelujah " and then listen to jeff buckley 's cover of that song on " grace " which was recorded in 1994. sorry , leonard , you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to jeff buckley 's rendition of your own song . it is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of cohen 's legacy . " tant pis , vers le bonheur .
1740,based on the reviews for this cd i decided to buy it without having sampled it . big mistake . i love , among others , marshall crenshaw , don dixon and peter holsapple , but what happened here ? this was so not fabulous
1741,it does n't sound like the people you list as reasons " not " to read this book , actually read " this " book . there is a big difference , in my opinion , of putting positive affirmations in your mind , versus a witch doctor . and quite honestly , it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in " conjuction " with medical care . does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care , because you will most definitely be healed ? no where . so in my opinion , one has to have a " sound " mind , and not view the book as a " cure all " for all the ills in life , but rather a positive way to " enhance " your life . it is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care , when you have a terminal illness , or any other illness for that matter . but according to what i gather from the book , you can use positive affirmations , and " believe " that you are getting well , to help keep yourself in a positive state , rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well . studies aside from this book have proven that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook , have done wonders for recovering patients , along with their medical care . your review did not address any of those people that read this book , because the two examples of people you list , it is apparent they did n't read the book either , ( not sure what compelled you to post here ? ) therefore you are not qualified , in my opinion , to critique this book , as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist , did they prescribe drinking snakes blood , too ? anyway , this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick , and those that do , probably wo n't be addressing their medical problem . can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis ? i imagine it can , ( studies prove it can ) in addition to proper medical treatment . anyway , you might want to actually read the book , instead of making comments of what happened to " so and so " who did n't even read it or apply it , including yourself .
1742,this cd is perfect for driving . the downtempo / beat driven ambient feel and overall togetherness of this cd is a perfect choice for easy electronic listening . overall very pleased with mr. schnauss ' contribution to the genre . highly reccomende
1743,i bought this a few months ago , and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly . it yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them , which is very painful ! it does n't pull them all the way out , which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue . sometimes it works okay , but what good is a razor that only works half the time ? others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it 's losing power . mine does sound " slower " when it 's yanking the hair , but that does n't seem to be related to battery charge ( e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode , and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in ! ) even when not pulling hair , the shave is not close . definitely find a different razor
1744,i ordered this product on june 7th 2006 , today is july 11th 2006 , and i still have not received it . i have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it , than to wait over a month for it to show up . i 'm really not happy with the turn around time for the tide he detergent .
1745,ok this is the third sony handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options..sony messed up with the usb port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the trv 280 i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the trv 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality..its fuzzy. . im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the trv280 back. . i hope this has helpe
1746,finally a book to deal with all those nasty pathetic ignorant people . i bought this book as i wanted a way to get even with morons i deal with day in & day out . this book has been a godesend to me . all i can say is thankyou robert m bramson for wrting this book . everybody who deals with people should buy this book . excellent for office workers customer services and whoever thinks they need it . buy it
1747,this has got to be the worst pile of trash i ever heard , right now i cant think of anything worse then this . the same ol trash bling and girls . and if you got jd and bow wow on your album at the same time , its gonna be wack . and do these n***** even know what franchise mean ? what does that word have to do with their name ? i 'll just start a click called ham & cheese and rap about flip flops and thongs for that matter
1748,i lost the weights the second day of use . bottom line the motion of the water as you swim unscrews the weights from the camera body . save your money on this one .
1749,i love the new digital canon . the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin . i had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working . the canon people have been great , and very helpful , but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory . the photos , however , are wonderful . film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable . ( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it , so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos .
1750,i went to ritz camera today and took a good look at the tz3. i 'll tell you , its pretty nice . the build quality is really good , as a previous person mentioned . the body is metal . the dials and buttons click with precision , and have a nice resistance . it has a nice weight to it . i took some nice shots in the store . i must have clicked off 100 pics . i 'm impressed with it . if you want something relatively small , powerful and tough , this camera is for you . the 10x zoom is great , but on such a small camera it is difficult to hold it steady enough ( at least for me ) to use the zoom too much . i love the build quality and style , so i may be biased . it 's a nice piece of equipment . i cannot speak to the photo quality only having seen pics on the camera 's lcd
1751,one of the best programs that i have to work with cd & dvd
1752,for years now i have been buying " bargain " cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one . finally , i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600. this camera is awesome . the screen is huge , the picture quality is great , it is easy to use and is sooo small . overall , a great buy . the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock . luckily , i have an sd card reader , so i normally just use that to download my pictures
1753,this book , styron 's finest , is about redemption . heralded by the epigraph from john donne , the intricately structured tale with its marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it 's impossible to put down . but it 's also to styron 's great credit that the novel 's theme , redemption through confrontation with death and violence , is reflected through its feverish style . there are not many books in the postwar era , and none in the united states , that have such a non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact . echoes of the greek tragedians ( several times evoked in the text ) and of dostoyevski abound . finally , the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate character , a philosophical italian small-town cop named luigi , elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers do n't even seem to understand , let alone approach . it 's a shame that styron has not received the nobel prize yet
1754,first of all , let 's talk about the noise level on this thing . yikes ! that should be against some kind of consumer protection law . the blowdryer part is ok , but did n't like the brushes at all . i 'll go back to my conair stying brush and my straightener . live and learn
1755,what 's not to like ? light , compact and comes with the strap , case and wipe cloth . they are perfect . keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still
1756,timothy hart lost his b-25 over germany in 1942 and is spending the rest of the war as a guest of the third reich in stalag luft 13. in 1944 tuskeegee airman lincoln scott arrives in camp and is promptly accused of cutting the throat of smuggler vincent bedford . the prisoners demand a trial , their jailers agree , and ex-harvard law student hart is appointed to defend scott , who appears inexplicably less than grateful . in fact their german jailers are more helpful to the defense than either scott or the american officers , or so it seems , as scott 's trial for murder progresses against a backdrop of class conflict , racial hatred and world war . atmospheric to the point of claustrophobia , a perfectly paced plot , and one of the few times i 've been completely blindsided by a novel 's climax . ps- -the film adaptation starring bruce willis is truly gagworthy , stay away from it
1757,as a 21 year old , i felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack . but , i was so excited that i had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies . imagine my disappointment when i could aurally pick out that rosemary clooney 's parts were not sung by rosemary clooney ! i do not recommend buying this album . enjoy the music when you watch the movies , instead . trust me , it 's better that way
1758,the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good . i bought this primarily to see jaco . the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 's added in . i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances . also , it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut . i still give it 5 stars regardless .
1759,i think that this is a very good operating system , but it is far too overpriced ! a note to the person who has the issue with disk#4 of his setup disk set : try and get access to another computer and run diskcopy , if that does't work , then boot into ms-dos with a windows 98se bootdisk and select the cd-rom drive letter and then type " cd i386 " then type " winnt " then it will start the installation from the compact disc . i gave it 4 stars because i believe that they could sell a better operating system for that price
1760,it is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again . i read them as a kid , but did n't get to read the very beginning . i hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on dvd . i will buy more
1761,i 've heard this book on tape , which , poor writing aside , is more horrifying to actually hear o'reilly read in his own voice . the gratuitous sex ( which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels ) is enough to turn anyone off , but that voice narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure . a sad , sad example of narcissism at it 's very worst
1762,what was john singleton thinking . i know he produces good films but this is far worse . the shaft from the 70s was sexier , cooler , more aggressive , and classer than jackson . this was a watered down verison where parks and roundtree made cameos . it 's almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character . no love making and ect . do n't even waist your time ! if you want to see it , check it out on cable tv or something . save your money
1763,i highly recommened these dvd 's ! how exciting and refreshing it is to pop in a dvd and go back in time to the 1970 's again ! its wonderful to rewatch such a a classic piece of tv ! truly worth adding to your collection
1764,at 10mp , this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures i have ever taken with a digital camera . the clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera . the display , although pooh-poohed by others as too small , is quite large to me . the cameras small , lithe design is another selling point . nothing bulky about this camera . you can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to . do yourself a favor and get this camera . you wo n't regret it .
1765,although this is a good batch of accessories , the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times . it has no carry strap - - the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top . so , if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture , you must open the case , pull the camera 's strap through the slit , then lift the camera out . it would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy
1766,if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper , then this is the brand and variant you should switch to . if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises ( rapidly dissolves.. . ) , i 'd have to give it five stars . it practically melts as soon as it touches water . do n't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink ; you 'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue . i 'm giving it only four stars , because it 's not my favorite toilet paper ( that would be charmin ultra ) , but the necessary choice .
1767,even if you do n't know much about donny hathaway , this collection of songs is a fun mix and it 's very moving . it includes some classics with roberta flack that are terrific . i enjoy it tremendously
1768,i grew up with the original ds . i also saw the two " spin off " movies : " house of dark shadows " and " night of dark shadows . " needless to say i was extremely excited about the " revival , " and i was n't disappointed . i felt that dan curtis was actually able to improve upon the original , by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove . the original barnabus was played by jonathan frid who was a shakespearian trained actor and , ben cross is a member of the royal shakespearian theatre in london . i loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual , which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth . and i must say this series lived up to my every expectation . dan curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera . i looked forward to 3:30 every day after school . it 's too bad that the gulf war killed it . yes it did ! i was there . after the sunday , monday miniseries , that friday was to air the first " episode . " however it was pre-empted by coverage of the war . too , too bad . i taped it , but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over . i am so glad to know that i can order it now in it 's magical entirety . i 'm ordering it right now ! thank you amazon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you are a fan of things that go bump in the night , you will love this series ! ! ! !
1769,having an m.a. in english literature as well as a b.a. in literature and history , anytime a movie is both historical and literary . . . well , i get a bit excited to say the least . i do n't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it 's not , but the writers / directors / producers set it against a " historical " backdrop nonetheless . on that note , this is yet another stellar title from noneother than ridley scott . with that being said , i enjoyed " tristan and isolde " almost as much as " gladiator " and a bit more than " kingdom of heaven " ( all of these , by the way , are ridley scott films ) . notice the historical adaptations here ? while it may be true that the story of tristan and isolde was inspirational to shakespeare 's " romeo and juliet " as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the arthurian legend , this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types . no sir , good ol ' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie . this is by no means a " chick flick " since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense . on the other hand , it 's not the typical " hack and slash " macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story . in short , it should please both sexes simultaneously . aside from james franco ( tristan ) , i was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast . sophia myles ( isolde ) is , for the most part , a newcomer to american audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly british films . i suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the atlantic . while many of the other characters were convincing in their roles , no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant irish king ( who just so happens to be isolde 's father ) . in short , this is one of the best movies i 've seen in awhile . on some levels it reminds me of " king arthur . " just as " king arthur " attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary arthur , guinevere , and lancelot , so too does ridley scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the angle and saxon kingdoms in england . if you 'll recall in " king arthur , " arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading saxons just as the roman legions were exiting britannia . historians will point out that there is no evidence of saxons in england until several decades after the roman withdrawal , but oh well . . . it made for a good story . here , we witness the celtic britons as they are exploited by the irish across sea . what ? ? ? ? the irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around ? well , " tristan and isolde " holds true to history in this aspect ; namely , that the celtic britons of england were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the anglo-saxons . this would , of course , have placed them in what is now wales and cornwall . and this is exactly where the movie is set . let 's not forget the story of saint patrick . remember , he was actually a romanized briton who was captured and served as a slave in ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to ireland to convert the populace to christianity . it 's interesting to note that in the movie christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in ireland , so no doubt ridley scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand . i particulary liked " king arthur " and " kingdom of heaven " despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics . critically speaking , " tristan and isolde " has been a bit of a mixed bag as well- --but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics ? rent it first if you must , but i suspect this one will be a " keeper " in your dvd library !
1770,the & quot ; latin&quot ; moves in this workout seem strangely like american aerobics to me . you can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves , but if you 're interested in latin dance , my advice is to buy brazilian dance workout with vanessa isaac instead . this workout just is n't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks
1771,if excelsior college did n't require this for the cpne , i would take it and throw it off the highest bridge i could find . horribly confusing , does n't make sense , and i cannot fathom how this would help your clinical practice . the only redeeming feature is that excelsior does not let you write in this , so i will have a brand new copy of this for sale to some poor nursing student . i do n't mean to sound harsh , but this book is n't easy to use , it is confusing , and contradicts itself
1772,when i found " hour game " in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale , i thought i had hit pay dirt . but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as " the winner " and " absolute power " could turn out such a dog . long , boring , and confusing . i fear that mr. baldacci hired an " aspiring young writer " to " help " him crank out a quick book . i cannot pass this book along to my friends - - i could n't do that to them . it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin . what a waste . what a shame .
1773," dave " is a lot of fun , as a look-alike gets to pretend to be president , gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power , and makes high-stakes enemies . i am a big fan of sigourney weaver , and she is very good here . kevin kline does well , as well . the forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile , and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love . definitely worth a rental , if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag
1774,britain , circa 1997. tony blair is elected p.m. princess di perishes . and the spice girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public . this effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing . to be fair , the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is . rather , they are appealing and prove to be the film 's lone redeeming factor . the fault lies in the script that tries to do for the spice girls what " a hard days ' night " did for the beatles . whereas the fab four 's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it 's trying to say about the spice craze . i was reminded more of the monkees ' " head " than i was of " a hard days ' night " . lots of celeb cameos ( roger moore , elton john , et al ) that amount to naught . oh , well . on to " from justin to kelly "
1775,i got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens . the solution might be useful , the blower is useful , the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips , but the so called " magic cloth " is anything but magic . it kept leaving lint on my lens
1776,i felt compelled to write a review having read another written by someone who gave it one out of five stars . i felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review , so here i am.. . as a musician i could think of nothing more intimidating than attempting to cover a buckley song . their fan bases are fiercely loyal and protective of their material . so first things first i would like to congratulate the artists for their bravery . furthermore a quick glance down the list of performers will quell any suspicions that this is ' just another tribute record cashing in on someone else 's success ' , these are musicians that know what they 're doing . what struck me the most was the variety of voices on this disc ; you have the ethereal whisper of sufjan stevens , sweet folk harmonies of the magic numbers , the lazy drawl micah p . hinson . not only that , but these are great interpretations from the jeff & tim cannon . very inspired and innovative - a beautiful accordion riff on ' grace ' , an irish-jig inflected ' no man can find the war' ...these artists do not desire to replace jeff or tim , they 're merely reuniting us with what they left us - their music .
1777,paid a fortune for this thing and it stopped working after 2 uses
1778,i checked the 3ccd from panasonic and the canon camcorders . in that price range this is the best i found ( if you have the extra money , the new hdv camcorder from sony might be your best bet ! ) . important:the ccd issues referred in other user comments are real ( although i do n't know if it will also apply to this new model ) . it actually happened on my previous sony . i purchased a 5 years warranty from sony for my dcr-hc90. 5 years is a good product life so i will take the risk of ccd failure after that period and enjoy this great product until then ! great features are : small but feels solid , 3 megapixel pictures ( impressive quality for camcorder ) , incredible low light performance , nice touch screen , great features . battery life is actually not too bad from original battery but you might need an extra . what i did not like : cannot take full size pictures in camera mode ( only in memory mode ) , limited zoom compared to most new camcorders and lots of required extra ( svideo cable , ilink cable , video light , decent size memory stick , extended warranty ) . i am still giving this a 5-stars overall .
1779,this is by far the worst kmfdm release.. . no esch , no schulz , just sascha and skold messin around with a little pig. . at first listen this album is not bad but once you get used to it , this album is really boring. . dirty , skurk , and preach / pervert are really the only songs worth listening to . i was embarrased to listen to " risen " . it was just lyrically horrible i do n't know what 's wrong with them . now in skold 's defense , he is a badass , his voice is cool and he 's a good writer his solo album is good . but we had him in symbols , adios , mdfmk , and attak it was just a bit much . this album is bland at times good and most times pretty bland . not what you think when you think kmfdm , though urban monkey warfare is still cool.. . whatever i am one guy buty it , if you like awesome , if not sorry. .
1780,the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i 've ever owned . my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [great camera ! ]. i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography . i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel . after a few months of owning it i still am amazed . the image quality is fantastic , it 's quick and responsive , and every day using it i learn a little more . it 's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it 's easy to learn . i 've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot . if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot , go for this camera , you wont be sorry .
1781,purchased a case of bally energy drink since i seemed a bit sluggish after a 12 hour work day and kept making excuses not to work out . gets me up and at em ' and no more excuses for not going for a long walk or trip to the gym ! drank 1 can in the morning @ 5:30 am and another around 3pm . give it a try
1782,some reviewers below have said that this microphone does n't work with the sony hot shoe . wrong . click on the " technical details " on this page and you 'll see the sony camcorder models that this microphone works with . failure to look at which camcorders are compatable with this microphone is the fault of the customer , not any fault with the microphone ! so do n't give it a low rating based on your own lack of research when buying a product , please
1783,this photo editing software package is unreal . it has more features and functions than you can shake a stick at . right out of the box i began some serious photo editing and got outstanding results . beats any other software in it 's price range . i have yet to read the manual or instructions as it intuitive . two things - do n't even bother with the free version of snapfire , which is included . it is redundant with pro photo and rather simplistic without much value . it is included as a teaser to get you to spend more money with corel by way of an upgraded version . and unfortunately the software is not well behaved and crashes to frequently . if it were not for this stability issue i would have given it a ( 5 ) star rating . corel - nice job but get it working better
1784,im going to rate this product a 2 because i like it but i would change a few things if i could . it does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff . the couple of things i would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord , you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds , then you have to stop and click play again . i wish there was an option where you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again . the other thing is something a little more important . the product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play , its called olga . well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore . so you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the beetles or metalica or the grateful dead or anyone else , and thats what they advertise " play hit songs " . so overall , knowing all this i would have shopped around more . especially for the price , its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs .
1785,i could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern 's classic - while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch . why ? depp 's " performance " is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off-putting , flat , self-absorbed , and finally , one-note . rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare . while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable . it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog . not much holidday fun , huh ? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and / or could care less about . the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with . what a waste of millions of studio $$$
1786,this program is terrible to deal with . i run a small business and bought quickbooks simple start . once loaded and you go to use the program there is a pop up requiring you have an administrator . when loading the software it does not tell you to select or bypass the administrator requirement . you only learn this when you first go to use the program . the url they give on the pop up for troubleshooting does not address this issue , either . you are just locked out of the program . now it gets fun . so , you have to speak to them for help . but this is where it gets to be no laughing matter . to get help you have to email them to ask for help . they then call you back at their convenience . if you are busy working when they call back you have to start all over . i have yet to be able to use this product since i bought it 3 weeks ago because they will not call back when it is convenient for me the customer and will not let me call in at my covenience . even worse , since they have bought out all their competitors quickbooks customer support no longer is available after regular hours when a small business owner has the time to handle such operations issues . i ca n't return this product for a refund because i have loaded it . my first clue to how not user friendly this product is should have been the title : simple start
1787,that nigga 's crazy and bicentennial nigger both surpass this album in laughs , but it would still rank high if it was n't for the poor sound quality- -there 's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly than pryor himself half the time . but some great classic bits , and believe me you 're never bored
1788,bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error ( appears like the shutter never opens ) and will not record video . spoke with jvc and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in . will update my rating after i see what is wrong , if they can fix it , if they will stand behind their product . watch for more details . before it failed only complaint i had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price
1789,i liked this when it first came out b / c i was 16. i was a rebel , wanted to be part of something different . this is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while . favorite song is mongoloid...totally strange but rocking song . " uncontrollable urge " rocks ( in a weird way ) and come back johnny is almost a conventional song . satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song . the group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a kiss , multi media , making money kind of thing . i saw them live ( they were horrible ) during their hey day . the most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream , devo is still as odd of a group as ever . mark motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work ( rugrats ) and you can hear the devo in all of his work . anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is . devo came out as a goof , not as serious musicians . they got big in the 70 's b / c they were part of the new wave and kids ( like me ) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own .
1790,i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now , but i would not reccomend this one
1791,this is a good book , but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book . einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory . for instance , e=mc^2 was not created by einstein , as so many people people . an italian physicist came up with it . if you do n't believe me check any encyclopedia . einstein suceeded in taking everyone 's work and compiling it . this was helpful to the world of physics . unfortunately , this stuff is outdated , and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book . when it came out it was already outdated . this was published in the 60s . autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s ( 45 i believe ) . if this was published in the 20s or even the 30s , it would have been a good book
1792,far from user-friendly , you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks , wondering " why did i get this program again ? " its like reading another language after using previous editions of word , which i was a big fan of . i guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it 's a nuisance . i ca n't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit . in the words of thoreau " simplify . " good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they wo n't be able to view the newere version . get used to saving in " 97-2003 word format . " also , wo n't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner . at this price , you could do without the headache .
1793,perfect solution for using those windows programs we are used to...but on the mac . runs smoothly . entourage is a fine email program and word , excel and the others work great . a little spendy , but worth it if you need it . entourage communicates well with oulook and has a similiar feel
1794,overdrive , watching the rain , enchanted , teaching myself to dream , glow , lemon , because i can are really excellent songs , this album is really worth it .
1795,i have no personal experience with 12-step programs nor do i have dominant addictions ( other than book and dvd buying ! ) but i am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking , over-eating and love addictions in particular . i was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients . this book takes a rational-emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach . i also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful but he seems to have quite a personal , and often over-generalised , attacking crusade against 12-step programs . some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12-step programs were valid and useful . similarly i welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless . however he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12-step programs - and in very derogatory judgmental language . he often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people . i got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone . there appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements ( and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered ) . i would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive language . he could have suggested modified views and tools , and alternatives to consider . i ca n't imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12-step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for . however a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground
1796,this is n't a full review but some thoughts i 've had after using it for a long time . stabilization - the fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you , you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash . if flash does n't bother you , no sweat . but i 've never like the look of it . ease-of-use - great . voice memo - i use this feature all the time . it would be nice if it had a pause button because without it i end up with many small files . ex - this is where you set the exposure . casio does a great job putting everything in one place . the only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection ( e.g. iso 200 to 400 ) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot . instead nothing happens . you have to click set first . it 's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time
1797,brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them . this is a blatant effort to wrench young children 's emotions and therefore their perspectives about the eeeevil effects of " global warming " by engaging their sympathies . the only plot is brainwashing , using penguins as the straw man . the penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them . as a responsible parent , i would avoid this entirely .
1798,the title of this product is a joke . it should be called " not easy cd burning " . roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is . it is way too complicated for burning simple cds
1799,while i am not sure what exactly these do taste like , i do n't detect the peanut butter here . the texture is good , chewy enough , but the taste is...odd . not at all sweet . i ca n't imagine any child ( or adult ) grown accustomed to high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these . bleh . if you want peanut butter , the clif bar has a much better flavor ( and an even denser , chewier texture ) . if you want a z-bar , i slightly recommend the chocolate- -although it too tastes a bit odd and is inferior to the chocolate clif bars . builder bars are also worth a try , sufficiently sweet and flavorful . of course , with these alternative product lines you will get about twice the calories . although i will not buy these again , i give the company a star for a worthy effort
1800,fight club is without a doubt the greatest film i 've ever seen . yeah , i 'm a fanboy . and what ? and to make a great film flow , you need great music , right ? well , you need great music that fits the film , and the dust brother 's score more than does the trick . the film is dark yet satirical , and it needed a score that would compliment that . however , the score simply does n't stand up on its own . at times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere , but its only a part of a tense scene . and hence , it sounds rather empty by itself . no matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it ( as i did ) , i would n't recommend it . like so many other scores , it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film
1801,compared to fp 2000 and earlier versions , it offered some major improvements , even letting one code in ( gasp ) php with live preview - it is highly configurable , and easily tied into sharepoint ( well , i think that was the intent ) . it was quite an evolution , moving beyond fp2000 , with some fairly advanced features - while still retaining the " entry level , small business learnable " functionality ( albeit cookie cutter designs ) of previous versions . i was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with frontpage ( an odd change , knowing ms ) , but also offered other code functions , some on par with dreamweaver - but do not mistake this for dreamweaver , even the first mx version . it 's still aimed at microsoft only - you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else ( e.g , php , cold fusion ) - but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions . mostly good , some horribly bad . the good - being able to tweak it to dozens of standards ' compliance , sec . 508 , xml'ish stuff , whatever . by default these things are not set up , so it does take some learning . what annoyed ( and freaked me out ) was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with access , to create database driven sites - the database had to remain in a public folder - ok , i suppose if you 're using it only on an intranet . i believe the point was to code with access , then mod it slightly to interact with sql server - but most folks probaby did not use it that way - knowing the history and " fire and forget " ease of use of frontpage.. . anyhow , i 'd call this a para-professional version . it has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of frontpage , ever . it is also going bye-bye . there will not be a frontpage 2007 , due to the switch to expression web ( which retains some fp functionality , but the " friendly " and pesky " bots " are gone ) . no more email bots , whatever bots - gotta learn how to roll your own .
1802,i 'm a huge don cheadle fan , but this film is unworthy of him . [people] who claim that it 's a story about racism either do n't understand the film or do n't understand racism . basically , here 's the plot : the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store . rather than summon help for the others , all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register . he is caught , and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life . that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film , because pfeiffer 's family insists on proving that he 's no animal and can take his punishment - - in this case , death - - with his head held high . yeah , right . guess what ? he is an animal , and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters , racism would n't be an issue . a more compelling question : if pfeiffer 's family was so concerned with his " dignity , " why did n't they teach him moral values in the first place
1803,what i like best is that it is non addictive . it puts you right to sleep within 20-30 minutes . it really helped me and my boyfriend regulate our sleep patterns
1804,after brushing with the hydrabrush , my teeth feel as clean as when i 've been to the dental hygenist . this is a great product . i am so glad that replacement brushes are available at amazon
1805,the author not only argues for feminism , but she does so in a unique manner , and innovative approach by arguing for feminism across borders . she compares and defines literary and national borders . this book is extremely thorough on all aspects of chicana feminist writing available , by engaging historical theories as well as contemporary notions . to really grasp the experience , the author has certainly covered her basis in terms of depth , substance , truth and validity .
1806,i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you 're facing in your own relationships are commonplace . they 're not dysfunctional . every family has its share of issues and you do n't need to feel overly guilty for yours . the book 's underlying theme is that families that honesty , consideration , character , belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience , can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it 's probably ( though not always ) worth the effort . stories include : resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up ; the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife , the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead ( and the effect on kids ) , dealing with the families of your in-laws and family objection to marriage , how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you , dealing with the death of a child , how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing , etc. although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations.. . actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life ( with all it 's frustrations and headaches ) and balance it with everything . if you have any relationship , friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration , resignation about then i strongly recommend this book . it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could change your relationships and your life
1807,there is not much i can add to these reviews here . just like me , a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters . why would such an abomination happen ? suge knight is trying to milk the pac legacy until it is bone dry . well at least he has done something right if you ask me . it sucks that this is how we are forced to remember tupac shakur , over tracks chopped up into this . die hard pac fans wo n't even like this , if they have n't heard it already . i 'm so waiting for a remix album of " the chronic " and " doggystyle " . if suge knight was smart you would reissue tha dogg pound 's " dogg food " on dual disc , because that is the only reason why i do n't have that album yet .
1808,i know a lot of people liked this book , but i felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds . i did n't realise so much of the book was focused on diet . it says you should plan on gaining a pound a week , and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be . well the first 13 weeks i managed to gain nothing , and i felt horrible about it , but food made me so sick the last thing i could do was eat more food to try to gain weight . the book said that according to my starting weight i should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy ! i decided to stop reading the book , and so far , just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when , i 've managed to put on 20 pounds . my twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy . this book is n't horrible , but i would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used , do n't spend the $ on a new one.. . and be prepared to put it down if it does n't sound right to you
1809,i use ms office at work , and at home , but for my daughter 's computer this was perfect . most people do n't need the full version of office , and this package has so much for so little money . the full version of word is reason enough to spend this amount of money . note : this is not the latest version , but who cares . i would say this is one of the best software deals out there . unless you need 100% office compatiblity , this is the package for you . if you do , buy the student and teacher version of ms office . read the fine print , it is for anyone not using it for business
1810,on a recommendation from a friend , heimgest , dcg-or , ( who rarely recommends any book ) , we found this book to be one of the absolute best on the subject of our gods & amp ; goddesses . a must read , it ranks well with both rydberg 's and grimm 's teutonic mythology
1811,do n't buy this ! i regret that i did n't listen to the people who left feedbacks . the craftmanship for this item is very bad . not only the product was made of cheap plastic , it was missing a screw too . i would not recomment this product
1812,arrogance by bernard goldberg is a truly enjoyable read . goldberg does n't waste time trying to create a vast left wing conspiracy tied to islam or communism , he just presents the facts as he sees them . as a former insider , he 's got the dirt on media bigwigs , and he 's not afraid to dish . the liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big three networks and turn on cable to find an escape . goldberg offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by coming up with several suggestions ( some tongue in cheek ) for correcting this slant . he also includes surprisingly frank interviews with tim russert and bob costas . goldberg 's other books bias and 100 people who are screwing up america are also excellent reads . he does n't attack people on a personal level ( although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against dan rather ) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across . some books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up your hands and give up on this country , but goldberg 's books do n't have that effect . you can tell he not only loves the country he lives in , but also the profession that he 's chosen , and he has hope for the future .
1813,for years , i had heard the akashic records being touted as the unwritten spiritual book of life , that included every event , every living soul who had ever taken a breath from the beginning of time through eternity . the subject was beyond fascinating , as my limited mortal mind could not grasp the enormity of such a body of knowledge " existing " . however , i took it on absolute faith that this was so and recently endeavored to find the quintessential book on the subject . knowing of mr. cayce 's tremendous psychic following , i assumed this book would enlighten me and others . i excitedly bought a new copy for myself and sent another to a friend . after trudging through the first 68 pages , i felt lost and befuddled . the writing and text are difficult to follow and not at all in " layperson 's " language . perhaps this book is meant for an experienced psychic mind and intellect , one who understands the language and is willing to muddle through the long-winded case histories to discover meaning and relevance . my friend confessed she had read a mere chapter or two , then set it aside . pie dumas author & life coach
1814,ugh. i did not even try to finish the book . it is full of sexual content . not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature
1815,a terrible , terrible waste of money . all this cd serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head paul godfrey is . face it : no one gives a sh@t about morcheeba anymore , we 're not interested in who ' inspired ' them , ( poor annette peacock - has anyone told her ? ) . the next time we see paul godfrey he 'll probably be asking that age-old question : & quot ; paper or plastic ? & quot
1816,i was literally horrified when i first put this album in my cd player . this cd is absolutly terrible , every song sounds like its been composed for some middle school band to play . furthermore the songs hardly sound like the songs they represent , they 'll go through like one riff from the origional then just do their own thing . do not , i repeat , do not purchase this album . i was expecting some cool , fun , funky lounge music but this cd is just obnoxious . the only thing that makes this cd remotley worth purchasing is the cool album art and free coaster
1817,great price , good product , escellent service . i will buy from this supplier again
1818,a true musical genius . take a blow get a zyr voduski and snapple lemonade and let the music cover you up . powerplus from the 70 's and 80's . tight lyrics and pop masterpiece arangements . go todd go
1819,dj quik ( the best producer ever ) did all the tracks in this one with help from robert bacon on some tracks . this album is just classic nuthin more to it !
1820,i bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - so i thought one of them might actually be hot . instead , the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot . this may be a " lawsuit friendly " reality with heating pads today - i 've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago ( i had that one for 10+ years , the sunbeam replacement i bought prior to this one lasted 2 and was n't hot ) .
1821,i saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies i have seen during the last two years . stupid , stupid and stupid . ryan reynolds becomes annoying . if you have brain , never watch this movi
1822,i owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f / 2.8 version . overall i was very happy with the f / 4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight . sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses , and the f / 4 can provide plenty of background blur . if you are shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend the f / 4.
1823,i recently purchased this software and had to uninstall it . in my case , i was unable to get into my quicken account , which is password protected . one of the features of confidential is an " information vault " which stores all passwords . i was prompted to enter the quicken one as well , but chose not to as i felt this would defeat the purpose of having a password set up in the first place . after that , when i would enter the quicken password , my machine would just hang up . the only way i could get in was by opening it in safe mode . i believe that this product sounds appealing on the surface , but when you get down to it , it promises more than it can deliver . i also think that when it comes to internet security , the best solution is to take reasonable precaution . if you respond to an e-mail requesting your account numbers and passwords , a software package is not going to save you . i purchased this product based on my previous experience with norton products and have been quite satisfied with their performance . thus , i was extremely disappointed with this product
1824,thank you for sharing laci and your story with me . this book is superbly written and shares with the reader a mother 's love for her daughter and angst over her murder . how tragic to lose laci . how disgusting & heartwrenching what you had to endure since laci went " missing " . i highly recommend this book to all . beautifully written by a loving a mother
1825,while not every song my be my favorite , they really did a great job compiling the popular and favorites from the great 80s hair band days ! all the monster cds i have bought have been real gems .
1826,this is the worst thing since the office assistant animated paper clip . forcing the " ribbon " on the user assumes that the user likes icons ( i do n't - - what 's wrong with words ? ? ) , and fills too much of the screen real estate . nothing is where it should be . and what arrogance on the part of microsoft to provide no alternate views , no " classic " view , just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons . another oppressive , giant waste of my time and money at the hands of microsoft .
1827,ok.. . i do n't know who reviews batteries but this one is pretty good .
1828,this is the first slr camera that i have ever owned . i bought it because i was going on a trip around the world , wanted a nice camera , and had it recommended by a camera shop owner . it is extremely easy to use , so easy that i could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries i visited , point to the button they needed to push and i ended up with a great picture . i did n't need to explain a thing . i also did n't mind carrying it around all day , it is very light for its size . i have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures . i have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera , from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great . the action shots are never blurry ! the only complaint that i have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting , sometimes it is slow and sometimes it wo n't work at all . in these cases i just turn on the manual focus option . all the options that the camera has are great , but to be honest i rarely use them . i 've found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center . if i know that i 'm going to be taking action shots or landscapes i will set the camera to that mode , but often i forget and my pictures still look great . i think that this is an excellent camera , especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a slr camera can give them . there are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses , so when the photography bug gets you , this camera can stay with you
1829,if you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on enigma records , hang on to that out of print gem ! straight to hell is back on cd as straight to hell returns , and may have a lot more tracks this time , but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track . not appearing this time are : " the good , the bad and the ugly " by the pogues , and my personal favorite " money , guns and coffee " by pray for rain . the track " the killers " by pray for rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the original , but on this new release was shortened to only 2 minutes . this is rather perplexing considering straight to hell returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds , which would have left room for those other tracks to be included ( since cds can run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds ) . i 'm deducting a point from my rating of this cd because the missing tracks should have been included ! on the plus side , this new release contains a lot of short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the original cd release in 1987 , as well as some brief dialogue excerpts . the film was a misunderstood classic , and the soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful : the pogues , joe strummer , pray for rain , zander schloss , elvis costello 's macmanus gang , and even dialogue excerpts from courtney love before she was , well , i guess the word is " famous . " if you 're a fan of any of these artists , you 'll love this assortment of songs...those not familiar with the film may not be able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals create , so get the film on dvd and you 'll appreciate the works of these artists so much more . the liner notes claim this cd is to be considered the " official " soundtrack , while the first release of it back in 1987 was basically a " souvenir . " i enjoy both releases immensely , but since i was listening to those other deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now , it 's sad to not hear them this time around
1830,just repeat the following several times . 1 ) draggy plot 2 ) uninspired acting , especially allen , who almost sinks it 3 ) unimaginative ( story , direction , etc ) then get a hitchcock film
1831,someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size . well , that person is n't alone . the camera i purchased is a canon s2is , which i love . the lense does n't fit it . i even bought the hood / lense adapter set and it still does n't fit . this simply is not the right lense for a canon s2is , no matter what amazon suggests . now , too much time has passed for me to return the lense . i 'm stuck with it , and i do n't like that
1832,the movie had potential : good cast and interesting plot . its the kind of movie you want to like , but just can't . i did not find it all that funny or romanic . it seemed that the mother and a bride 's maid were suppose to be funny characters but i found neither very amusing . i have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other ; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie . their relationship is not developed well at all . as another reviewer noticed , there is a bit of pretty woman here , as dermot plays a male escort . for whatever reason , julia roberts as a hooker is cute , whereas dermot is not . i found is pretty disgusting that messing falls for a male prostitute . there is a lot of crude sexual humor that i did n't care for . my favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the english countryside , which is really beautiful . its not a terrible movie , but i would be upset if i paid $10 to see it in the theater
1833,it was everything it was reported to be . it works very well . we take it on every trip we take
1834,smaller size did not fit me or my son . it would be nice if you could use perhaps a hat size to determine right size . standard size worked fine .
1835,with a good script and a director better suited to the material ( i 've read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct ) , asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson . unfortunately , the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms.. . a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession . the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist 's wife ( an excellent natasha richardson ) and one of the asylum 's patients ( an equally good marton csokas ) , under the watchful eye of the patient 's doctor ( ian mckellen ) . there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie , some of which seem quite preposterous , at least in the way the movie was shot . the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson . she does her best in spite of the choppy script , and she even won a best actress award in london for this film . however , as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession , director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job . ( in fact , i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson , credited as an executive producer , sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out .
1836,this shaver is the best shaver i have ever used . it gives me the closest shave . it is very comfortable to hold . it is great . my brother-in-law liked it so much he bought one
1837,i bought this book just recently and was really touched ( and cried ) by the whole experience that gus had went through . he has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance ( stephanie ) and without her , he could 've been out there on the street again . overall , it 's a good book to read and i always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another , this book is a genuine prove .
1838,i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars . but after watching it again , i realized i liked it better ( i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you ) . i do not consider all of the performances goth . martiya possesion are more tribal than anything ( at least on this video ) and i really dislike the expression , or lack thereof , on their faces while they are dancing . they either look completely bored , pissed off , or smug . i skip right over it . i also did not care for asharah 's dance to the drum solo by solace ( " opaque " ) . the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all . the music is saying " fast , big , upbeat " and she 's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves . and of course , we all love the s&m piece...excuse me , s&m is not part of the goth subculture , and has no place on a bellydance video . jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer , but she did n't dance much on this and i did n't want to see what was on her part . another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music . i like solace and all , but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre . there were a few , but not enough for my liking . my favorites on this video were tempest , ariellah , jeniviva and ayshe ( for wierdness factor ) . for all of its faults , this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose
1839,at 300mm this lens is very soft , it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus . to do so , you need to shoot at about f / 11 , and then since there is little light available , you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed . of course , the high iso then introduces other artifacts . the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on . this is a lens that i have constantly fought with . do n't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either , as it 's only marginally better . buy the 70-200 f / 4l . it 's a far superior lens
1840,i 'm pleased with the purchase . i bought this camera just under two years ago when i was getting ready for a trip abroad . i spent six months in england , with five weeks travelling around europe with this camera in its case on my belt . it 's very sturdy if nothing else , between the trains , planes , hostels , and general bustle i 'm very pleased with how well it held up . nothing on it broke . i probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip , if not more . sure i 've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years i 've had it , but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well . the zoom on this camera is very nice . it 's one of the better zooms i 've seen on a simple camera of this type , or at least it was back when i bought it . it also has several features that older film cameras do not , such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture , or settings to take " portraits " or " night shots . " i know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras , i know that it does n't have all the frills of the new digital cameras , and i am not trying to compare it to those . i 'm not a professional photographer , so i do n't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot . i do n't want a digital for personal and professional reasons . for a traditional film camera , this one is the best i 've ever used . bottom line : good quality photos , a sturdy build , excellent zoom lens , useful and easy to use features , and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks
1841,as he did with " parade " , the soundtrack to his last vanity project " under the cherry moon " , prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to " graffiti bridge " , which is a hopelessly silly film . no matter . " graffiti bridge " , prince 's first album of the 90 's , is also one of prince 's best albums of the 90's . " new power generation " serves as the title track to prince 's new band , and it 's a powerful , funky manifesto . " the question of u " is exotic and intoxicating . " elephants and flowers " is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption , whereas " tick tick bang " is prince at his most joyously raunchy . although most of prince 's material is exceptionally strong here , the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag . " we can funk " is a simmering duet between prince and funkmaster george clinton , and tevin campbell provides some youthful exuberance to " round and round " . but the tracks by the time mostly fall flat . i 've personally always found morris day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine , and his one trick gets boring quickly . it 's obvious that with " graffiti bridge " prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party . but i ca n't help but wonder , without the tracks featuring other artists , if " graffiti bridge " would n't be more highly regarded as one of prince 's better albums
1842,when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery . they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes . now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime , a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got the camera , charged the battery until the light went green ( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it ) and started taking pictures ( oh i also got a 2g cf ) worked great....so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots . keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong , still have 200 shots left for the trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button . so all in all , i think the battery life is great , now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point , the original will work fine . as for the quality of photos.....i love them
1843,i guess i 'm to dumb to purchase an item like this . i followed the instructions to the letter and it 's not working . i guess i should have read the small print . sent an e-mail to xitel for help and waiting for response . will re-rate later .
1844,i affirm the positive comments of the other reviewers . i am a truck driver and dairy farmer and just finished the books on tape version of this book . i want to run away to graduate school and get at phd in physics . i hated science in school . i especialy recommend this book because it affirms true learning . it really does n't start until you fall in love with a subject and go after it just for the fun of it and for the most part on your own . much of the book is about his love of physics and scientific exploration . he touches upon how to do education wrong with his stories about science education in brazil and his work selecting k-12 science texts for the la school system . my independent road of becoming a dairy farmer affirms his thinking , and i am so glad i did not try to get an ag degree
1845,all there products are great ! they smell good and are good . lathering is a more work but thats because they 're natural . i use them on my babies and toddlers
1846,picked this up to try out because of the ratings & price . did n't do a thing for me . wipe it on , let it haze and wipe it off . no difference .
1847,i am a user of acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the disk director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use , i partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so , i know that you can but just have n't found out how yet , it could have been made a little more simplier to use
1848,i watched this film yesterday at a library , and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding . during the first minute , they tell how the revolution began when high bread prices sparked a violent uprising . during the next 99 minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing violence , using acted scenes , fake blood and sound bytes from " scholars " , to give a " play-by-play " summary of the carnage and beheadings , leading up to a mention of napoleon . during the last thirty seconds , they surprisingly conclude by saying that the french revolution was a very good thing , because it inspired china and vietnam and because louis was a tyrant . prior to this little or no mention had been made of louis ' tyranny , although the film had dwelt on his bedroom difficulties in some detail and also mentioned his weight problem a few times . after watching 90 minutes of bloody scenes , i found the films conclusion that the french revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non sequitur . i would have liked to have seen some historical analysis to support this conclusion
1849,the product has very good themes and screen savers . some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully i will use them in the future
1850,( responding to joel g 's review below ) it 's unfortunate that your child was unable to enjoy didi & ditto because of a technical problem you had with your computer . the majority of didi & ditto players are running microsoft windows and enjoying this great educational software . if you send us an e-mail message at service@kutoka.com , i am sure that someone from our technical support team will be able to help you resolve the issue you seem to have experienced with your computer display . also note that all activites can be unlocked in the activities menu by pressing the f6 key on your keyboard . a full list of the game 's keyboard shortcuts can be found in the user 's guide which is accessible from the start menu . hope this helps
1851,always looking for new books on this subject as they are few and far between . this book is written by a cop who knows the business . really like the way its written , funny at times as well as informatove , good read actually enjoyed what can be dry material . highly recommended
1852,before you get all worked up , let me say that he has a voice , but he really does n't have a style . he sings songs way too straight , he makes even bobby short sound like an improviser ! he also does n't seem to be in touch with his masculine side , his vocie is very , well if ying is male , and yang is female , he sounds very yang . he needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he wo n't sound so obnoxious , then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying ( masculine side ) in his voice . he needs to hear a few billy eckstine lp's . i do n't think he can change but here 's hoping he 'll take my advice . as far as you buying this cd it is your decision , this is just my honest opinion
1853,my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the pampers cruisers ( size 3 ) from 4-month-old . it is soft and my baby never have " rush " with it . my whole family love this diapers .
1854,i ordered zonealarm internet security suite 2006 after a pc magazine review , i have a 3 month old hp media center pc . th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice . each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer . i lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe i decided to return it . i did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product . i am now using norton internet security with no problems . i transfered it from an older abandoned pc . i mave been a pc user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software . this is one of the few programs i could not instal . i have used the free zone alarm firewall without problems . ew
1855,in my opinion this is not a marketable product . the cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work . there is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix . when it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit . as for hd - possibly at high noon in the sahara , but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing .
1856,this small flosses is great . to get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it . the little plastic floss can break and get stuck between your teeth . happened at least couple of times so i switch to the string floss
1857,i take two of this product before bed and it relaxes me and helps me sleep
1858,i 've always read lots of books about singles and how to find a mate , and that rate has sped up since i 'm now a romance coach . but somehow i had missed susan page 's " if i 'm so wonderful , why am i still single ? " even though it has been out since 1998 , the last year i was single myself . where have i been , and why had n't i seen this book ? susan page writes for " involuntary singles " - - straight , gay , male or female , each and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren't . relentlessly positive , she starts off right to the point with " so why are you still single anyway ? " and then , just when we 've gotten over that shock , she states flatly : " whatever your reasons are for being single , if you want to be in a relationship , no reason is good enough . " then page goes about tearing apart every good reason we 've ever come up with to keep ourselves single . here 's what page takes on and turns around : ambivalence ( my favorite ) , those " dreadful statistics , " the myth of " there are no good ways to meet people , " and having and keeping high standards . then she works on developing skills in what she calls " frog kissing " : learning to say no , how to recognize true intimacy , avoiding " commitmentphobes , " handling the intimacy gap , and learning to say " yes . " and in the last section , " keeping it all together while you look , " page tells you just how to do all that . this is easily the best , most thorough , rounded and positive book about relationships and dating i have seen . if you are one of page 's " involuntary singles , " this book needs to be in your library . five chocolate dipped strawberries for susan page ! this is quite a book .
1859,this cd is 100% pure junk ! the cd is sung by kids ! they have high-pitched voices that are n't even good enough to win the school talent show . the other singers are adults who have voices that are n't anything impressive , either . if the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better . stop this s****y music !
1860,this was part of the marvel action hour along with iron man . at first , the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters , but the series remain true to the comics . the story lines they took from the comics were done very well , like episodes involving the silver surfer
1861,this is a good compilation of afi 's songs over the 10+ years they 've been together . it 's easily worthy of 10 stars . this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow , and to get more intimate with the band . i hav n't purchased this album yet , because i already have all their albums , but plan on it . the new tracks are from the answer that , and very proud of ya era . they 've finally been released on cd . this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also . anyway , buy this album only if you hav n't heard any of afis music but want to give it a try
1862,i have to say that even though teti hatcher 's performance was good the movie itself was terrible . the plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable . i can ; t believe i wasted my money on this one
1863,this album was by far the bands most daring ablum . they went away from the classic inxs sound that made them superstars ( kick , x ) and instead updated their sound to fit the time . like a previous reviewer noted , this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the us , and unfortunately , caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part . its sad too , cuz there are many solid tracks , inlcuding heaven sent ( my favorite ) , not enough time , baby dont cry and beautiful girl . i have recently become a big fan of inxs and have purchased all of their albums . i like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums . i recommend " welcome " to any inxs fan and any other fan of great music
1864,this is jeff beck 's best album . a masterpiece of guitar work . this is an all instrumental album that features what jeff does best - play guitar . the supporting band is excellent especially the drum work . production quality is excellent as well . while i would n't consider jb a blues guitarist i would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this album show cases why . a great companion album to blow by blow is wired . it 's a shame that after wired his record company made him go back to albums with vocals . he has on a roll and at a level that he has rarely gotten back to . if you like guitar and can live without vocals buy this album . you will not be disappointed
1865,i 've been using remington 's shaver saver for 20 years . it keeps your shaver clean , lubricates well with not too much gooey oil , and works in an instant . i use a remington ms2-100 microscreen 2 , and after a shaver saver treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves quicker and closer . a treatment seems to last for a while and i do n't think it 's necessary to use it every day . usually 2 to 3 times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue to perfrom like new
1866,i originally bought the edit 120 ( no detachable case ) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often ( to leave at home ) . then i came across the edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly . not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet , i was somewhat concerned about the method / design of the atachment . it needed to be easy to remove , but it also needed to be secure ; the pictures i found on the internet did n't show how it was attached . i was relieved when i actually saw how it was attached . there is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag ( an open slot is at each end ) . the add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro . the attachment method is secure and is almost invisable , and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag . i think the original bag is very good , and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice . unfortunately , you have to buy this as a combination . if you originally bought the 120 single bag version , it does n't have the slotted bottom on it and ca n't be retrofitted ( and i do n't think they sell the detachable bag separately )
1867,with a very good scenario and a fantastic kris kristofferson the film is slow , over male attitude , and finally poorly made and boring
1868,polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some " pop " out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it is canon , it must be quality . " since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance
1869,i began using gillette 's mach 3 razor when it first came on the market , and was very happy with it ( until recently.. . ) the original mach 3 would give consistently good , smooth shaves , and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves . that was an excellent product . however , with the introduction of the new fusion razor , the mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves i was getting were much rougher . i had heard about the fusion and decided to try it instead , figuring may that gillette was trying to " migrate " its users towards the fusion by downgrading their reliable old product , putting all their new design juice behind the newer model . i was shocked by what a shoddy , difficult product the fusion razor turned out to be . i went from getting several good shaves per razor to , well.. . none . i 'm lucky with the fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge - - usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass , and it does n't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the mach 3 used to . what 's the deal ? did gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product ? that they 'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away , rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one ? if so , that marks a huge change in their corporate policy , from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off . i know they *can* make a great razor - - they used to - - but if gillette has decided to stop doing a good job , then forget it . so much for my customer loyalty . i 'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there 's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old mach 3
1870,i would n't know i never got my cd and its been over two month
1871,the elastic part is tape and my husband accidetly stuck it to our daughters legs . when i changed her diapr next she screamed because the tape was on her leg not the diaper . this could happen to anyone , nd i 'm sure it 's not good for a new baby 's skin
1872,this is a great camera . plenty of resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . the kit lense does n't do the camera justice . buy the body separate and add a better lense . on the bad side , i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix . it was two months before the camera was returned . sorry , canon.. . you lose a star for that
1873,i was reading the high reviews of zonealarm so i went to their web site to get more information , and only about 2 pages of their entire web site would even show up . makes me wonder how hard it will be to get tech support from them . going back to panda. .
1874,its just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like hard to earn anymore.. . gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys
1875,i was first touched by pavarotti 's voice as a teenager in the early 80 's when i saw a pbs special of this concert on television . the power of his voice and his personality are incomparable . his rendition of ave maria is especially touching . i would recommend this as a first buy for anyone who is new to the operatic experience , as i was so many years ago
1876,this book is important for every one who has a back " issue " . given 5 as gifts to loved one 's experiencing back pain
1877,i bought this item as a gift , and it ended up becoming mine . i have to say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here are some main issues i am having with the camera : 1. it is very poorly designed . the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant . buttons are really ugly , and operating the camera is awkward , and for some functions requires both hands to operate. . 2. the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally . 3. the worst , by far , is the picture quality . colors are just plain terrible . automatic settings are a disaster of photography . i have used a canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . the canon was far superior in quality , colors , lighting. . i do n't need large files of trash , i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures . as a result , i am strongly recommending getting a different camera . i have had great experiences with canon ; and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , and indeed many other devices .
1878,first i would like to state that sooner or later every computer user will come in contact with some problem with an internet security program . they are human made and not 100% fault proof . i study and work in the it field and was first introduced to pc-cillin through trend micro 's product housecall . soon after i tried out the trial and have finally bought the product . i love it ! i have used several of the other " major " anti-virus suites available and have had tons of problems with them . mcafee after one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that i had to completely reformat the pc to gain functionality again . norton to say was n't much better . if you are installing on a " clean " pc where these other software suites have not been , i have not had a problem . i have installed / uninstalled pc-cillin many times each time running smoothly . the software has been a valuable asset protecting my pcs by alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were not even on my network but on my isps network . as well as protecting my network from one single computer that received a virus by shutting off traffic to that pc . i can understand where some of the other problems reported with this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just unfamiliar with the framework of the software . but if you already have some experience in how to set this type of software up i really do recommend you give pc-cillin a try . it is a sleak program , easy to install , easy to customize , and really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks and threats . with all its competitors out there i would choose pc-cillin over the rest any day of the week
1879,i just bought this for about $190 at the local px . i am impressed so far . i was going to buy the gs180 , but for the sale price i would be crazy to pass this up . so far the low light is much better than a single ccd . the video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape . i plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale . i will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around europe . i look froward to using this camcorder a lot
1880,first , ou can barely tell this product makes a change in humidity levels in the room . secondly , it is extremely noisy and interferes with baby monitor
1881,the league of extraordinary gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie , its pretty good itself . where else could you ever hope to see the likes of captain nemo , dorin gray , mina harker , the invisible man , dr. jeckyl / mr. hyde , allan quatermain & tom sawyer all in the same movie ? about the only character the production is lacking is sherlock holmes . the action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors . the only real drawback is the length . about 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes . all in all , a good popcorn flick .
1882,this disc was simply a waste of my time...very mediocre songs , heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent...corey 's voice is below average....i get the feeling that corey clark is imitating a good singer with a viable career , and not doing it very well....clearly ' fake it till you make it ' is n't working here . the songs all sound the same , i kept waiting for something to get me grooving , but it just did n't happen . i think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential...he either needs voice lessons , a little humility , and some professional grooming ( and i do n't mean clothing ) .
1883,i pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b / c washable ones were sufficient . with my second child , i did both and i found these to be the best b / c washable ones are not enough . they are large so wo n't shift when you roll in bed . they are very absorbent though i have woken up a couple times trenched . they are very thin and discreet . other pads are not as big so not enough overage . i never bother with the adhesives b / c they do n't work . they are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk . i just wished they were softer and less paper like
1884,the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful
1885," dark tort " was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read , but for a novel that 's supposed to be part of a quirky , light mystery series , i found things a bit leaden . the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered , and when we finally do move beyond that scene , a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further . i do admit that it also does n't help that i 'm one of those people who ca n't suspend disbelief and have to ask , " ...so she 's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified ? " but , that 's just me . oh , well.. . many of the recipes did sound good , though i doubt i 'll get around to making any of them . this is one of those reviews where it 's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series ( which i personally have n't read but suspect are n't much different than this one ) , you 'll likely enjoy this installment , too . the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b . parker " spenser " novel for our light mystery fix .
1886,do n't buy this camera really . i had it for a month and was taking good care of it . i was initially thrilled . the lcd screen got damaged - - no i did n't drop it . the treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that i was shocked . the customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if i were an idiot . a $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible . it was a great camera at first , but i demand better treatment and respect from the company . look for a better camera , look on the web for comments on their customer service and do n't buy this camera . i had read very negative things about sony but did n't think they applied - - they really are true . i do n't like being called a liar by anyone especially when i am the customer . the camera is a month old and it is now garbage . while i understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty , i will not accept such poor treatment and customer service . i teach photography and will tell my students the same thing - - if customer service and respect matter to you , then do not buy this camera .
1887,i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography . i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion . if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them
1888,ralph fletcher and joann portalupi have teamed up to create a book that is easy to understand and apply in the classroom setting . the lessons can be adapted for all elementary grades and everything is spelled out for you as the teacher - including the titles of books to use . those familiar with the 6 traits will find concrete examples to help develop each skill
1889,a lot of people seem to snub their noses at let 's talk about love because it was n't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it , but all in all , it 's still a fantastic snapshot for celine 's career in 1997. celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly ( falling into you was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time ) but it was very worthy . among my faves on the album include " the reason " , " immortality " with the bee gees ( for a " celine-less " version of the song , check out the bee gees ' 2-disc hits collection from 2001 ) , " love is on the way " , the very funky " treat her like a lady " , " to love you more " and the beautiful singalong title track . this album also housed " my heart will go on " which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million . while it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes , i 'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful , powerful ballad . with " falling into you " and this album , celine was the #1 female artist for a period , becoming a superstar right as mariah was abandoning ac for r&b , as alanis was going on hiatus for awhile , and when shania was taking off but had n't yet exploded into major-superstardom . love her or malign her ( it seems fashionable to do the latter ) , she became one of the premier voices in adult contemporary and won over a large audience . i have n't been a fan at all of her last few albums , but if she ever comes back with an album like these two , i 'd snatch it up in a heartbeat
1890,i recently bought a new celestron nexstar 4se telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit . much to my disappointment , the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope , and when cold ( nights in colorado are 25-45f ) , the eyepieces did not fit at all . celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised . when i called a second time , they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem . amazon replaced the kit ( thank you amazon ! ) , but the replacements did not fit either . i 'm returning that kit too . i finally bought a kit from meade ( 3 eyepieces and a moon filter ) that fit properly and are very easy to use . to be fair , if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value ( hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1 ) . the meade kit is a worse value , but because they work in my nice new scope , they are the best for anyone using a nexstar 4se
1891,we returned this video camera due to video picture quality . the camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video , even after changing settings , the video had a " grainy " look . we just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work , but the picture was worse than our previous camera . purchased the pv-gs65 , next model up with 3ccd 's and love this model . as a matter a fact we still had the gs-31 , used the same tape , shot the same footage , and reviewing the two different shots , the gs-65 did 100% better . the camera has a great feel in your hand , although the menu button can be difficult to press
1892,i have been a barry manilow fan since i was a teenager . i have never been disappointed with any of his work and this cd is no exception ! he is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous ! his voice is as good as ever ! even my 7 year old begs to listen to the cd everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words !
1893,gosh , i would really like to review this adapter , but- - - amazon has put my order on indefinate hold , as thier supplier is unable to get any more . but wait ! what 's that blurb on the product page - " availability : ususally ships within 24 hours " and " want it delivered tomorrow ? order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes , and choose one-day shipping at checkout . see details . " so they ca n't deliver it , yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow ? do n't order from amazon
1894,very cheap , you can tell it 's an fake camera miles away . sure it has these features of motion detector which makes it move and has led lights ; but not worth 6 dollars at all . stay awa
1895,i clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here , who will all have to forgive me for thinking that susan cooper 's " the dark is rising " is plain awful . this book was recommended to harry potter fans who have run out of hp books to read . i must say it was a waste of my time to read " dark . " never have i read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero . in this case , we are told that on his 11th birthday , an english boy named will stanton discovers he is the last of " the old ones . " unlike jk rowling who , in the first pages of harry potter & the philosopher 's ( or sorcerer 's ) stone , provides the reader with a vivid description of harry as skinny , with an unruly mop of black hair , startlingly green eyes , and , of course , a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead , cooper does not describe will stanton at all . the result is that the reader , after having read 244 pages , still cannot visualize what will looks like ! ! i also find quite annoying cooper 's approach to this good vs. evil tale . she is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are the old ones , and who or what exactly is the dark . as for the dark being evil , all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that the dark means cold , snow , and- -of course- -darkness . excuse me : but is this the best cooper can do ? is this what this book is about ? - -the druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark , summer vs. winter , warmth vs. cold ? what happened to the conception of evil as moral evil ?
1896,another hyprocritical nut . these christian fundamentalists like are literally screaming jesus , while cutting your throats , not unlike the jihadi fundamentalists . the only thing is they cant do that now as they used to couple of hundred years back by enslaving and lynching blacks , killing native americans , and showing their christian love for the jews - by exterminating them . hope our future generations dont have to live in a christian saudi arabia . this is what these whackos envision
1897,i have had mine for over a year , i *love* this camera ! it is so easy to use , takes great pictures , is very easy to use and program etc.. . i love everything about this camera . ps : unlike the other poster , i have not had any battery problems at all
1898,the spiritual quest made understandable . tolle is able to communicate new ways of thinking that are life changing , and are not so esoteric to make you say " huh ? " . i would read " the power of now " first
1899,not a fan of graphic novels or cgi , i was fully prepared to dislike this movie , but found it to be so well written , cast and shot that i will no doubt buy it for my collection . it 's a dark movie , subversive really , but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people , that one strong person with a will , determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them , can turn the tide . it 's a powerful message , and it 's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery , symbolism and script . bravo
1900,the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture . it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk .
1901,i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work . i did n't really have high expectations for it , because it was so inexpensive . as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it on , it always says " usb connected ! " - - and i do n't have a usb cable inserted into it ! this also freezes the device . i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted . 2 ) i cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual . my computer does recognize the usb device , but when i try to copy files over to the frame , i get a " path is not found " error . 3 ) i thought i could live with the above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures . so i used a card reader to load .jpg files onto a cf card at 400x300 resolution . when , i plugged the card into the frame , these files show up as " invalid " when i try to view them . emailed coby with the 3 bullet points above , got a response 30 hours later saying : " coby tech support to me 5:25 am ( 3 hours ago ) hello , we have received your inquiry . it appears that your unit is defective . return the unit to the retailer for an exchange . " what an inconvenience and disappointment . i will be buying a different product
1902,i got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it 's great . i know i should probably replace the head by now , but it still seems to work fine , so i don't . i 've only changed the battery once . if you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type , this is it . then again , if you 're not lazy or weak , you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries
1903,im not sure where to begin with this review , its not that the book was poorly written , quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal . it was quite infact extremely boring , by page 300 i could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point i have loved the gunslinger series , they were all very good from front to back . there is way , way , to much about susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged , maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no wastelands or wizzard and glass . it was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement . it got to the point where i had to try very hard to pay attention and often i would find i had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again . im giving this book 2 out of 5 , very poor story line , poor plot however it was written well i can only hope that the next book is better , cmon king give me the feeling wastelands did , blown away ! ! rather than tired and exhausted
1904,my boyfriend bought this for me not realizing that my camera came with a case ( i have the sd200 ) . this case is n't a good fit for the camera and i 've never used it because of that
1905,that about says it all . bill bryson is a hilarious writer . i like reading grammar books anyway , but i was always excited to read this book , as it 's so entertaining . besides that , it can teach ( or remind ) you of a lot of good rules of writing . the main problem is that several entries are unnecessary , and some necessary entries are left out .
1906,i bought this dvd collection to use in a presentation i made for a graduate school class to complement a book review of murrow . this collection is facinating for people who love murrow and those who 've never seen his work . i will use this collection in future presentations that i 'll make to my students as a professor . every person in broadcasting should buy this collection and watch it to get a great look at the man who innovated our business
1907,well , the fact that i 'm writing a review about this book , while it 's sitting open on my desk next to my computer , open and not being read , might be some evidence of how i 'm enjoying this book . this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which should n't be so difficult . this book is not clear or easy to understand at all . every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote , and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page ( ! ) , making this work look like a research project for a phd publication . i have the casebook in this series , and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity . and it turns to be true ! this book might be good if you 're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail , or as an advanced reference later on , to look something up like in an encyclopedia . some concepts , which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book . it 's too complex for a first-year student . sometimes it starts describing the different views out there , and then there 's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is . i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors .
1908,while a little dubious , i am know a believer- -really helps me get motivated and stay energized focused for my workouts . start with a single scoop and adjust as needed
1909,ah , yes , it 's nirvana 's " nevermind " cd , released in 1991. i listen to all 80 's pop-metal , or hair metal ( whitesnake , winger , van halen , y&t , dokken ) i could go on forever on 80 's bands . ( of course there is rick springfield , and john cougar mellencamp ) . i am a true rocker here , i know all the true bands out there , i know everything about them . i have reasons for this . but here 's the bottom line . nirvana was a breakthough along with soundgarden and pearl jam back in the early 90's . millions of people bought those cds . and yes , there were hair bands still alive back then , like poison , and firehouse , etc. firehouse and poison had alot of success , eventhough it was n't the 80 's anymore . as i can see , alot of my fellow rockers do n't really like nirvana , or pearl jam , or soundgarden . to be completely honest , i like their music , i just do n't prefer the music , because i do n't like the hard sound . i really like the glam-hair band style . people say : " nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam-metal " . yes , i agree that they killed the 80 's hair bands , but it 's not necessarly their fault . it 's a mix between the bands , and the people listenting to the music . because of grundge music , today 's music is quite horrifying , with emo and other types of music that would 've been a nightmare back in those days . nirvana has a great cd here , but i just do n't prefer it . if you are a real rocker , you 'll listen to all the types of music back then . do n't judge unless you have actually heard it , because you may actually like it . to all rockers - do n't listen to modern music . it 's poisoning our people , and no one really understands the true meaning of " the guitar " in today 's music . most of you will understand what i mean , so listen to the classics . classic rock , and hair bands forever , and even grunge . keep the classic alive . ~the sicilian axe ma
1910,following the demise of soundgarden in 1997 , everyone was curious what chris cornell would do next . would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood-curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different ? he chose the latter . with natasha shneider on keys and alain johannes on guitars , cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily zeppelin and sabbath-rooted musical background , and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record . the result is a very diverse album , highlighting cornell 's immediately identifiable vocals and relatively more simpler songwriting . that said , he had the chance to incorporate a multitude of other instruments , including tambourine , theremin , and timpani . besides the trademark blues rock-ridden songs that helped cornell make a name for himself , he also digs deep into psychedelia , best heard on " preaching the end of the world " , a song that finds cornell opting for thick , radiohead-like arrangements , lofty acoustics , and a strange mix of keyboard and guitar effects . not too different is " disappearing one " , guesting soundgarden drummer matt cameron with its moving vocal melodies , shimmering keyboards and even a vague clarinet addition . surely , soundgarden fans expecting a very heavy record with meaty guitars and lots of aggressive vocals will be sorely disappointed . but they need to realize euphoria morning was meant to be different way before cornell started working on it . solo projects serve the purpose of letting the artists express themselves in ways they are unable to in their own bands . and considering this , euphoria morning is a huge success . that said , there are still some songs where the band behind cornell churns out some rocking riffs and rhythms , such as " flutter girl " and especially " pillow of your bones " during the chorus . the former starts out in an almost poppy fashion but quickly picks up a playful funk bass line and is finished off with a cool blues lead ; whereas the latter is more straightforward , employing lots of acoustic and electric guitars as well as weird percussion work . the final song " steel rain " is also a number that alternates between decidedly heavier parts and more haunting , ominous moments . the ethnic drumming ( great tabla rhythms ) on this track is quite experimental given cornell 's music with soundgarden and later on with audioslave . " follow my way " and " when i 'm down " are the most moving songs , with the latter featuring a deft piano and organ melody beneath cornell 's heartfelt delivery . this is another song that embraces his love for bluesy guitar work and it also features some female backing harmonies during its pre-chorus . similarly , the title track is a passionate piece where cornell sings entirely a capella over acoustic guitars . there are no other instruments ; cornell plays his guitar and simply sings his heart out . a remix of the effect-laden " mission " would later be included on the mission impossible 2 soundtrack while " moonchild " became a minor hit with its eerie atmosphere along with the opening song " ca n't change me " , perhaps the most modern-sounding , upbeat song on the album . despite being only three minutes though , its flow is majestic , borrowing harmonica , tambourine and shimmering keyboards that climax at the final second . my european copy of the album contains a very different version of the opening song , with french lyrics , accordion , mandolin , and female vocals backing cornell . the song returns to its english chorus at one point , but the rest is all delivered in french and perhaps more engaging than the original version in some ways . chris cornell is one of the greatest voices in rock and this solo album is testimony to his greatness . when freed from any band restrictions , the man is capable of crafting some of the most moving and brutally honest songs ever .
1911,bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago ( three computers at home ) and worked ok - no viruses . then i did what i thought was a clean install of xp pro from xp home on one of the computers , and it carried over a lot of garbage from xp home i wanted to get rid of , but that 's another issue ( clean install ? }. after installing xp pro , i was warned i did n't have virus protection and so i tried installing my nav again . you would think at some point nav would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a windows upgrade , and that the nav was legitimate . nope - fatal error and computer lock-up , which i was able to survive . no contact opportunity at the symantec web site . i simply opted for microsoft 's recommended anti-virus software - computer associates . another twenty . then i had a heck of a time uninstalling nav , which would n't install and now would n't uninstall . what a waste of time and money . who creates these viruses ? we certainly know who benefits from them . there is really nothing you can do - they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout . this little note means diddily , but thanks to amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something .
1912,this is a great program if you never owned an older version of family treemaker . the new version is so similar to the older versions it does n't pay to upgrade
1913," domestic disturbance " is a thriller about a divorced couple and their child . frank ( john travolta ) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife susan . the guy ( vince vaughn ) is well liked by the community , but there are hints of something being amiss with him . frank 's son claims he witnesses his mother 's new husband rick commit murder . the more frank investigates rick , the more suspicious he looks . the investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse . there is great interaction between travolta as a concerned parent and vaughn the cold heartless type . the tension between them breeds suspense . the would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him . there are few things he would n't do to get his way . " domestic disturbance " is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action . i highly recommend it for those who enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last minutes .
1914,i switched to tax cut years ago after turbotax ( in 2003 ) implemented their idiotic validation scheme . i figured i was doing my part to punish intuit / turbotax . and for all those years i 've been happy with tax cut . not this year . i found some major bugs which cost me a lot of time . i had my return done , but the numbers were seriously out of whack - - i know i did n't have that much income ! going back through the interview process did n't turn up the source of the added money . only by checking the actual " forms " did i find that several copies of 1099-misc forms were hidden from the interview process , and by adding the same data in non-hidden copies , i was double entering the data . there was no easy way to recover . i eventually had to wipe the installation and start all over . a call to tech support did absolutely no good . the person on the other end did n't seem to understand the problem with having " hidden " copies of forms going into the calculations . if those are hidden , what else is it doing wrong ? i 'm not quite sure how do deal with this next year . go back to turbotax ? hope tax cut fixes its problems ? or go to a human tax preparer ? whatver my choice , i 'm not looking forward to it .
1915,i 've been a loyal norton anti-virus & utilities software customer since the stone age , but like several other reviewers , i 'm deeply disappointed that norton internet security 2007 is incompatible with zonealarm pro , sunbelt counterspy , and microsoft antispyware , and even more deeply disappointed that i had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out . once upon a time , norton was the epitome of well-designed , thoughtful , customer-centric software , but they 've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name . i 'll be returning symantec 's software if i can , and buying zonealarm 's a / v package instead
1916,walk two moons sharon creech joan gray mrs. cooper in this heart - touching , heart-warming story about sal and her past comes together binding wonderful stories of her and her best friend , phoebe . her grandparents take her on a road trip . along the way , she describes her happy , sad , and beautiful stories . touching you heart one story at a time . i loved this book . it was not only a good , but also a great book because , it teaches life lessons , and it 's sad in many ways , at the same time beautiful . this book teaches you that life is there , you have time . it also teaches not to judge ` a man until you 've walked two moons in his moccasins' . and to not let sad things effect you , and so much more ! i love this book so much . if you 're fifth grade or older , no matter what it will touch your heart . i would suggest it any day . it will be a page-turner from beginning to end . you 'll never put it down . so pick it up and start reading it !
1917,i can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book , but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training . here 's the problem . the book and cd basically outlines a method of ear training , it is not ear training itself . for example , for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the cd . it is just that , an example , not a training . so , there is one 14 note " lesson " on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals . i do n't think so . however , if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals . you could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that 's the core of ear training . in fact , if you 're an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords . by the way , the cd itself mostly uses really dull organ patches . the idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction . however , since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone , this is another example of how this book / cd in itself wo n't be of much use to students .
1918,in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book , hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century . the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details , witty asides , and ( especially ) luxuriously reproduced introductions . hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages ; he hopes to provide brief , non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science . there is astonishingly little text , and at times the pithiness , compactness , and occasional " cuteness " may work against readers ' understanding ; there 's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here . some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader . ( this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time , event horizons , and brane world models . ) the text is aided greatly , however , by the beautifully rendered four-color illustrations . even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first , the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design 's artwork will attract , engage , and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation . overall , then , the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated . yet it 's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further . if you 're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here , i strongly recommend ( as does hawking ) alan guth 's " the inflationary universe " or brian greene 's " the elegant universe .
1919,the title says it all , im so happy i bought it and i listen to it all the time :
1920,purchased for my mom to use and she loves it . she says it is easy to use and she really enjoys making personalized cards for people . if she 's happy with it , so am i
1921,we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 , 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there . there is no rhyme or reason to the story . i gave it two stars because the landscape is great
1922,purchased this software because i got a deal with a special price break . i have a very small business , so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly . the set up took a lot longer than i had anticipated . the customer service was no help - could n't answer my questions . i ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted . i 've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since i 've spent the money , but i 'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime . if this is " quick books , " i need to find " lightning fast " books somewhere
1923,i switched from the digital rebel xt . since i already had l-glass lenses , i did n't run into problems with the 5d " exposing " cheaper lenses . the 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor ! the burst rate is simply astonishing . missing flash does n't bother me , heck it 's a $3000 camera , i do n't expect a built-in flash . i have the speedlite 580ex , which of course is wonderful in itself . i also have the battery grip which i recommend , as well as the rs-80n3 cable release . image quality is superb overall - the 5d really shines in high iso numbers - more so than even the 1d from what i 've read . even at 1600 there 's hardly any noise . it allows you to take great , crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash . the camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time . the 3 fps might bother some , but i prefer the incredible burst numbers .
1924,this was the first digital camera i purchased . i am an adventurous person and wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle . this camera was n't it . the good *it is compact , which is pretty convenient *it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy . the bad *after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes , the camera leaked and broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over . *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use . rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want . the pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . *the zoom sucks . do n't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience . *the image stabilization is a joke . you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that are n't blurry . *the user manual left me with a lot of questions
1925,i woke up this morning to the grating sounds of " good little girls " blaring over my clock radio 's single , worn-out speaker . a speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year , such as " there goes my life " and " live like you were dying " . " good little girls " is easily the worst country song i 've ever heard - and i thought neal mccoy was bad ! blue country is the c&w equivalent of wham ! ( a dated reference to be sure ) maybe i 'm just getting too old for country music
1926,unlike versions up to no . 6 , this version require authorization . this means that a single use version ca n't be loaded on multiple computers . adobe informed me that this was not a bug and wanted me to buy multiple copies eventhough i am only using one computer at a time . this version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install . when i found out that my legal version could n't be used , it forced me to reinstall version 6 , this took almost an hour to install , reboot , un-install and reinstall the orginal version . why is adobe the only company that forces this ? their program installation do n't even skip from one set of four numbers to the next . they force you to type the dashes between the numbers . if you have multiple computers stay away from anything above version 6
1927,this dvd is a great complement to the dvd 's offered by vce ( trinity and beyond , nukes in space , etc ) . by itself , it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials , military equipment , and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the dvd set . the quality of the film varies between the three discs . the last civil defense video on disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble , unfortunately . but , it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format . i 've owned trinity and beyond for several years , and i really enjoy the way it is presented . but , it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it skims over a lot of information about testing procedures , etc. you begin to get the impression that the military was doing these tests for their own amusement . after watching this dvd , i have a much better understanding of the entire process . it 's easy to see why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days of the atomic weapons program . the science of the atomic bomb was a moving target , and this dvd outlines the research they made . though i would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever again , their sheer power is fascinating , beautiful , and frightening at the same time . if you are interested in the science of atomic testing , you should really take a look at this set
1928,i have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now . i decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar i recieved as a gift . it 's a pretty good method . sometimes a bit difficult to work with , but you do learn some things . i stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when i realized that i had a bass amp . so make sure you have all the right equipment , and i would have to say that this might be easier for someone who 's taken guitar lessons .
1929,this pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it - - pour out all the water - - the filter comes crashing out ! it 's top-heavy . i much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge . it may be clumsy to refill - - which is why i thought i 'd try a pitcher - - but it 's extremely easy to use
1930,this is a cd that one can listen to countless times . the virtuoso playing and beautiful tone produced by michael aptly display the characteristics of the euphonium . the selections are for college and graduate level players , as well as the occasionally & quot ; gifted&quot ; highschooler . a must hear , and a must buy
1931,this movie is great . i just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it . i throughly enjoyed it entirely , i believe it kind of relates to fatal attraction
1932,this is a great collection . i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on . it 's truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy , but my son is hooked on it now too
1933,this is a nice lightweight tripod from sony . stable and well built . i have used it with both still and video cameras without any problems . it would be nice if it came with a travel bag of some sort
1934,i was reluctant to buy this after reading that it was n't so great on fine hair , but my son 's hair was really getting shaggy and i was *not* going to wrestle with him at the barber shop again . so i bought this and was so happy when it worked perfectly on his hair . i used the 1 inch guide for his whole head and he looks great ! the vacuum got all the hair which is a good thing , because i cut his hair wherever he happen to be in the house . he did n't have to stop what he was doing and sit still or wear a cape , which he hates . having his hair cut at home also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer- -what it sounds like , and feel like- - in his own time and environment . he cut his stuffed bear 's hair first , then daddy 's , then his own by himself and then let me cut his . what a relief to have a nice haircut and no kicking or screaming . at $25 , it has already paid for itself . i 'm so glad i bought it . i did n't give it 5 stars , because it is pretty loud and had a really crappy users manual .
1935,this is not a high-tech digital frame . it does n't play mp3's . it does n't come with a remote . it simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode . there 's an " on " button and an " off " button . there is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame ( though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet ) . it 's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off . if you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location , or choreograph your pictures with music , then this is not the frame for you
1936,one only needs to watch ball of fire to realize the depth of barbara stanwyck 's incredible talent . i 'd match her up against any actress of her era or any other era ! ! here is a woman who can rip your heart out...even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi-dimensions of her characters . sugarpuss o'shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive , good-looking gentleman . but she also shows her love to the other professors . 1941 was stanwyck 's greatest movie year.....she made " meet john doe " and " the lady eve " in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them . stanwyck is the only actress i can think of who can do anything ! ! from drama to comedy , to musicals and of course westerns ! ! while stanwyck 's singing is not on a par with her other talents ( her singing was dubbed in ball of fire ) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film ( this is my affair where she plays a vaudeville entertainer ) . bette davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting . she could n't sing or dance ( as barbara did in ball of fire , lady of burlesque , this is my affair and banjo on my knee ) . katharine hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms , high patrician attitude and she could never play a part in a musical . she could n't sing ) . joan crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she could n't sing . doris day was brilliant in comedy , musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy . the same with judy garland . rare is the talent who could do it all . i dare anyone to disagree with me that stanwyck was the one who could do it all....drama , comedy , westerns , musicals ! ! heroine or villainess ! stanwyck 's work is always first class even when applied to material that is not . she was simply the greatest and i 'm sorry this review has turned into a tribute to stanwyck but she should have won the oscar in 1941 for ball of fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses ! ! the movie , ball of fire is great fun ! ! from beginning to end stanwyck and cooper are unbeatable ! ! ! and the other professors are hilarious to watch as well ! ! there is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch !
1937,you 've got to be kidding me . there is no english translation , just pictures and mandarin phrases . how are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase ? they 're suppose to be teaching mandarin to an english speaker , not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language . this is retarded . worst product ever .
1938,very happy with the lens , and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself
1939," the talons of weng chiang " is a wonderfully creepy pseudo-historical tale full of mood , atmosphere , and an unusual amount of violence for " doctor who " - -almost as if departing producer philip hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out . but it 's not all gloom and doom . this storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old " doctor who " humor at its funniest as well as thrilling " doctor who " adventure at its most gruesome . the dank and dour city streets and slums of late-19th century london make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation , madness , and serial murder ( technologically refined cannibalism , really ) , and yet the doctor 's many clever quips and leela 's naively astute observations on " civilized " victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout , and the main villain 's second-hand man , li-hsen chang , has some incredibly witty one-liners as well . li-hsen chang himself is a fascinating character , delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to " weng-chiang , " a stranded , time-traveling dictator from the future who has deceived chang into believing he 's a deity from the taoist pantheon . chang 's paranormal powers , foremost of which is hypnotism , definitely evoke the late victorian fascination with mesmerism ( see the poster advertising his show ) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil fu manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction , and yet he 's also a tragic figure in many ways- -a healthy , innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man- -uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his " god " and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process . in many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the pygmalion-style educational program the doctor 's putting leela through , to her annoyance . if li-hsen chang is an interesting and complex adversary though , the same ca n't really be said for his master , weng-chiang himself . he 's a rather unremarkable two-dimensional villain , i 'm afraid , complete with hokey bad-guy laugh and over-the-top acting . perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect , but if so , they overdid it just a bit . at times too he 's just more annoying than frightening- -every time the ever loyal li-hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the doctor , weng-chiang throws a fit , savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum . on this score , weng-chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one 's workplace . it does n't help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean-cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he 's presumably impersonating , so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing . all in all , though , this is an enjoyable adventure . the doctor is at his sleuthing best , leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior , and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion , all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting . and anyway , li-hsen more than makes up for weng-chiang 's deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show , while the cyborg assassin mr. sin is genuinely creepy ( especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls ) . so this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt- -or a dash of soy sauce , rather
1940,very good movie . great acting & plot . very touching . i am very glad i own this movie . i will watch it very often
1941,i 've been working with punch as / 4000 since v10.0 was released ( about 12 months ago ) . although i agree in many respects with the positive reviews . for example , there are is a large feature list . however , there are issues with the software . for example : - hard coded limitations in the software design ( e.g. four possible scale options for printing , does not support grid snap smaller than 3 / 8 " or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around on a drawing with any degree of precision , very tiny dimension text on windows , etc. ) - inaccuracies : i printed a 1:100 scale drawing that came out at 1:94 approximately ; - i could n't fit a scale house drawing on 8.5 x 11 paper , no print preview ; - there are limitations and inconsistencies with dimensions ( i.e. placement , snap to geometry , etc. ) - the powertools seem to be a series of independently developed add on modules that do n't necessarily conform with the application interface ( e.g. precision , look and feel , functionality ) - the elevation editor is very limited . it basically provides a visual representation of the drawing with some editing and texture applications - ca n't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently from the wall surface ( e.g. brick and siding on the same floor ) . - object library is very limited for plumbing fixtures , furniture , windows , etc. common items are n't in the library nor are they easy to find . ( you can create them yourself though ) . - the 3d object editor is ok but not terribly intuitive . - multi-floor buildings get complicated to work with once you add floors or ceilings . - once you add objects , drawings get big and slow very quickly . - import / export is limited in short as / 4000 could use an overhaul , an updated object library , a major upgrade to scale and printing and an overall clean-up to create a more integrated and functional product . also , incorporate user feedback into future releases
1942,not exactly the " vaults " blowing open , as stated in the promo . these are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s , when the group was on hiatus from serious recording . that 's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows , literary journals and graphic design firms . whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected , such as " reprehensible " , " rest awhile " and " certain people i could name " . but there are too few of these real songs , and they 'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career
1943,i have an olympus fe 100 camera and the battery did not fit ! my niece has an olympus fe 140 camera and the battery did not fit in hers either ! the company does not accept returns on batteries that are opened so i was just out of luck
1944,does anyone know whether this set will become available on sacd or dvd audio format ? how would you contact grp records to ask ? i only give it four stars until multichannel format appears .
1945,after devouring this book , i immediately passed it to a client who is developing a speaking business . lenny 's book is full of real-life examples and practical tips for communicating clearly and powerfully . whether you want to speak professionally or just communicate better in your day-to-day life , this is the book for you
1946,in the grand tradition of rational corp - this is an overpriced book from rational corp to complement its overpriced software . i must commend the healthcare example in the book that is described in fair detail . the book 's website is empty and does not supplement the book 's content - only contains a link to order the book and an email to contact the authors . if you have to buy it , buy a used copy or read the free marketing stuff on the rational website
1947,i was unsure if this product would be as good as the one sold at brookstone . it is great ! just as good as the ijoy sold at brookstone , but much cheaper . i love it
1948,this is just a plain sweetheart of a lens . it covers the useful 18-35 mm range ( which is 27-52mm on a nikon digital slr , which is a very useful range ) . this lens costs less than half the price of the ( expensive ) professional nikon 17-35 , and does almost as nice a job . sufficiently nice , in fact , that most amateurs will not discern much , if any , difference . while not built like a tank , i think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent , and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros . on a nikon digital slr , which will use the center portion of this lens ( due to the size of the sensor in the slr ) you can expect excellent , even spectacular results . this is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots , portraits , or just plain walking around taking pictures . someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent , versatile lens . this one is great for parties , vacations , and the works . the images i have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast , are very sharp , and have beautiful color rendition . there just is not a lot not to like about this lens . i give it 4 stars for overall performance , but 5 stars for value and price / performance . some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers . this is one of those
1949,cheap product in all means . it riped off my hair while straightening and did a very lousy jo
1950,i have had this camera for about a year . it has been nothing but a problem . first , the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems . i have spent hours trying to fix it . still has bugs in it no matter what i do . secondly , the camera is very unreliable . i have a wedding to go to this weekend and i do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too . how do i explain the problems i have had ? there are so many . the camera misfunctions continuously . sometimes it does nothing at all . other times the zoom lense will not shut . you turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option . i sometimes can not even shut the camera off i gotta take the batteries out to do so...if i can even find batteries that work in the camera . honestly , i call tech supoport and told them the problems i have having and they tell me that only kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some . so i went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries . the camera salesman told me that kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter . i believe him . so my camera which would not work...i asked the salesman to help me out . it did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable . he popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked . well , everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life . my camera now does not work with either batteries . probably only kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me . i personally do n't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good . really , when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed . i am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know i gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera . trying to save money on this ' disposable ' camera was a waste . stay away from kodak cameras ! if you do n't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews .
1951,i originally purchased this cd at a local store . so many of my friends and family loved it that i ordered 4 more from amazon at a fraction of the cost . it is a superb cd and i recommend it to all .
1952,the 5x7 digital photo frame from pacific digital is very cheaply made , the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly .
1953,this year , instead of renewing my subscription to norton system works 2004 , i thought would be a good idea to bring it up to date . i purchased norton system works 2007. the 2004 version worked fine for several years , while the 07 version could not be installed on my xp professional pc . the norton " consumer firewall " worked perfectly . they make it very hard to get effective help ( unless you want to pay them $9.95 per call ) . several sessions on their complementary " live chat " system proved useless . in the end , efforts to resolve the problems simply wasted an otherwise perfectly good weekend . i returned the product to norton for a refund . their return procedures indicate that i will wait six weeks to get my money back . just wonderful
1954,i must be missing something , i bought this movie.. . when i watched it i fell asleep , its boring as hell trust me im a true horror fan and a gore-fiend , this movie was nothing , the only gore was when this guy cut some lady in the heart and it looked so fake... . the only scary part was the end with this witch , is everyone high but me ? this movie sucked ! boring as hell. . 2 stars
1955,a friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of chris rea via this very nice best of comp . he also recommended getting his road to hell cd . both of these cd 's were money well spent . i 'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80 's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity , mainly due to his top 20 hit " fool ( if you think it 's over ) " . for some reason i never equated that song with this artist . the thing i like most about rea is his musical diversity . he can lay down a very memorable am pop hit like " fool " or " let 's dance " and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like " road to hell " . no matter what the genre of music , this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove . there 's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd . " auberge " and especially the wonderful " on the beach " stuck out for me . but you get many styles here . and each song sets a different mood . from the easy listening " winter song " or the catchy " looking for summer " . or some excellent blues rock like " road to hell " , " god 's great banana skin " or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off rea 's tasty slide guitar skills . i do n't know how i missed this artist after all of these years . but i 'm a new rea fan who now looks forward to his next album . whatever style that it might be , i 'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb best of. this is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist . if your like me , after hearing this cd you 'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums . i 've since picked up his late 80 's album " dancing with strangers " . another very nice cd . most of the music on this best of cd is almost 20 years old , but it feels like it could have been written today . in other words it 's well composed music that holds up very well over time . and i 'm sure if your like me and not familiar with rea 's music , the minute you hear " fool " or " on the beach " it 's going to bring the good part of the 80 's back to you . greatest hits cd 's should all be this good . highly recommended
1956,pedometer part is fine . radio part is useless
1957,i must agree with my 1 star friend . this book does n't deliver . it spends all this time talking about things that we could grasp just by looking in the help section of the program . it goes over basic things several times and makes it sound very complicated when it is totally simple . this book is good for people who have alot of time to waste and money
1958,i just got this printer dock with a camera , and the printer feature is a real pain ! the paper will almost never feed no matter what i 've tried . when it does feed , it ends up jamming . i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone . i 'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back
1959,first published in 1936 , this is the 12th poirot book , the 3rd superintendent battle book , and the 2nd colonel race book , and has no narrator . it 's the first case in which superintendent battle , mrs. oliver , or col . race appear together with poirot or each other , and the only case in which *all* do so at once . the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes , where poirot encounters mr. shaitana , a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip . shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose , which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he 's a victim waiting to happen . for shaitana , like a few other collectors in christie 's universe , has succumbed to a foolish temptation , and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius , but murderers . and being a connoisseur , he collects only the best : those who have gotten away with it . he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby , without naming names , and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of " tigers " ( poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger , but would do so from outside the tiger 's cage , having respect for the danger . ) poirot accepts the supper invitation , however , to find that there are seven other guests , including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers : explorer major despard , a strong silent type ; mrs. lorrimer , a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge ; timid young anne meredith ; and dr. roberts , a loud and jovial general practitioner . shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder , but otherwise the subject does not come up , and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead , stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players ! this is , of course , poirot 's fantasy case , as he once remarked in the abc murders - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another . there are only the people themselves , and their memories of the evening , and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed . solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved . but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they 'd committed and gotten away with ? rather than following poirot 's viewpoint in third person throughout , some chapters follow battle , race , or mrs. oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case . each represents a different style : battle is a professional police officer , race an empire-builder-type secret agent , and mrs. oliver a writer of detective stories . battle , of course , has a duty to investigate shaitana 's murder , and does so in an orthodox style , cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him . race deals with checking out major despard , the explorer who 's most clearly his kind of person . mrs. oliver , for her part , works on worming information out of not only anne meredith , but her roommate rhonda ( whose attitude is that anne could 've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she 'd been paying attention ) . and , of course , there 's poirot . he 's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn , pursuing two major lines of questioning : ( 1 ) describe how the bridge games played out , and ( 2 ) describe the scene of the murder ( the elaborate collector 's room in shaitana 's house where the bridge games were played ) . see if you can figure out where poirot 's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues , and what he learned from the responses he received
1960,kudos microsoft . my last go around with encare was with the 2004 version . at that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface . the various modules were n't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore , confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly . the new interface is quite simple but very powerful . it is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating . perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics . if you have not tried encarta in a while , check it out , there is much to like .
1961,make sure you get the cheats to keep a lot of cash in the bank . this game is totally addictive .
1962,i like this video for it 's frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself . like yoga , it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it . the energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches . the quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm . i found that in itself very interesting and different . it is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like . she shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing , a mind bender so to speak , and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it
1963,i love jeff goldblum , but he did n't carry this film . the film was ruined for me the second julane moore ( yuck ! ) and the ridiculous , lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film . it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter . what a concept . it just added to the disbelief of the characters ( stay goldblum ) , the storyline , and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel . jurassic park iii was n't much better
1964,i 've been working with foals for about 18 years . this book is well written and includes very good illustrations . it 's good for new handlers and experienced handlers ( reminders of different options to use with different personalities ) as well . i highly recommend it
1965,i 'm a big fan of the sopranos so obviously the f word does n't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the f word and mf . the stories and characters are superficial , boring and unintelligent . people who like this show are the same people who think that what makes the sopranos a great show is because people get " whacked " a lot .
1966,i had high hopes for this battery for my nikon camera . it promised more mah than the oem battery that came with the camera . unfortunately , it must be leaking electrons all over the place , since a charge in this model does not compare to the original . i would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original nikon battery . the price was cheap and you get what you pay for . if you are going to purchase this one , get two since you 'll need to keep one charging while using the other . cheers
1967,look , notation software is notoriously expensive . all musicians know that . so , when you see songwriter and its price , it 's a relief . everything you need is in this program . i only have one complaint . when adding an expressive dynamic ( p , mp , mf , f , ff , etc. ) you have to add one to each note to insure proper playback . that is a concern of mine since i use songwriter to notate songs and export them in midi for recording purposes . it leaves an ugly looking score . other than that , this is the best deal on the market for what it is
1968,a mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s . do n't even bother.. .
1969,great fan of the man they call ' sugar ' zucchero , but this outing is really below par . this cd consists of rerecordings of older songs , with the addition of other famous singers . did he send the original recordings to these people , en did they ad little pieces here and there ? it sounds like it ! none of the songs have gotten ' better compared to the originals . to me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money ( and get more attention for ' sugar ' outside of italy ? ) . do n't buy it , get ' oro ' , ' shake ' or ' blue sugar ' instead
1970,as a follower of the celebration story for many years , i was greatly disappointed by what i thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town . it was nothing of the sort . the book had the feel of so many pages of anti-disney propaganda , and the repetitiveness of a bad serial . the authors of celebration u.s.a. clearly made up their minds about celebration long before signing off on a mortgage . lacking in the detail needed to illustrate celebration 's experiment with the tenets of neotraditional style , the book offered splashes of cliched generalities such as " a return to the past " and " recapturing tradition . " it soon became some sort of mantra exhorting disney 's ownership of the town , the rules imposed on property improvements and maintenance , and , interestingly , the attention the town received . most tactless of all was the shadow of mockery cast on every description of residents , conversation with neighbors , and interaction with people doing what the authors should have been doing : giving the town a chance
1971,the scale is everything the manufacturer claims . however , with minimal use by one average sized adult , our scale lasted only about nine months . the balance part of the scale is very sound , but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components . i suspect that poor q&a will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere . today , my scale will not function unless i hold the batteries by hand ( not too practical when someone is standing on it.. . ) . conclusions : * scale design is nice- -looks good . * construction of balance components is solid , glass is very strong . design and construction of the power unit ( battery ) is rather poor . * scale functions as advertised for a normal sized ( 80kg / 175lb ) adult ... until the battery power clip dies . * buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections . hope this helps !
1972,is an product of great quality , is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera
1973,this is by far my favourite her interactive nancy drew pc game , and i have played them all multiple times . i loved the food aspect of it [my sister 's a chef] , in the cafe where you could gyp the game into letting nancy have a muffin or a bowl of delicious new england clam chowder anytime you wanted to making a sandwich for katie ; and calling bess and george to hear how bess is learning to cook from a tv show and hearing her worry about what she 's making . the puzzles were not nearly as difficult as some more recent games make them ; they were challenging but doable , took some moving about and kept the game adventurous . the bike riding was inventive , rather than a train or car or what have you , and i loved being down by the lighthouse , near the water . i believe it is one of her interactive 's best games so far and is the best bet for a nancy drew gamer
1974,i tried an inexpensive program first and found it just did n't work . this program has been fantastic !
1975,i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations . i also have the reg . plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it . if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc . if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine
1976,a very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex christian.we need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general . i wish some brave person would do a film about how christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective . this film touched on the subject , but it was not really the focus of the documentary.perhaps we will be " blessed " by a further exploration of the subject in the future
1977,after using this product for mac for over 10 years . i 'm done . the price keeps going up , the " tax-help " within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non-existent . the server meltdown this year was the last straw . their servers were n't too busy to let me pay to efile . but , apparently they were " surprised " by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service . baloney . i 'll use a pencil and paper next year before i give intuit another $100.
1978,great for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne . i began using neutrogena as a teenager 25 years ago . it helped clear up teen acne & has kept my skin free of razor burn in more recent years
1979,i have now seen about twenty asian horror films , and this series definitely ranks among the best . i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles , but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance . bleak , bizarre , and ultra violent , yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent . this film maker has something to say , and will beat you senseless to make his point . in short , if you want to see ringu #25 , stay away from this one . if you feel a bit more adventurous , i highly recommend this series
1980,this is one of the ultimate collection 's of pure music at its finest....1 problem thou...on the inside cd cover all the tracks have the wrong names...kinda crazy if u like to rip songs for your collection : (
1981,this is a poorly designed camera case . you have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures . i expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot . i was very disappointed . this is rather a leather box than a camera case
1982,i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films . to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection . i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film . but i was very disappointed to say the least . the movie takes place in the early eighties . when gangs dressed in leather with chains , carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally . this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in . if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed
1983,i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring . it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters . he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for " the swede " , without letting us know who the swede really is . roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration . it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book . i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times
1984,e40 is the worst mc i have ever heard i would rather listen to someone drag their nails down a blackboard . how on earth can someone like him get a record contract and sell records . anytime he comes on another rappers album no matter how good the beats are i always skip the track
1985,the kit was not worth its price . the spatial effect is poor . i 've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red-blue paper glasses . no , i do n't have visual problem , and i rigged up everything correctly . the dvds itself were not interesting . my kids were not impressed much . it were not made me happier with the pack . sorry this review seems against the others , but it is my truth . i 've stored it back into the box . i do n't recommend this for you
1986,i really enjoy the nancy drew games . they can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done . the check list continues to update as you move through the game . i look forward to each new game as it comes out and ca n't leave the computer until they are done
1987,we enjoyed this video . the rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting . somehow , these tough , big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to " sporn " .
1988,it 's not an item to write home about . final picture quality is usually ok but not spectacular . the wi-fi works some days , mostly not . if i 'd known then what i know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser .
1989,atwoods collection of shot anecdotes , prose , and takeoffs of traditional narratives creates a delicious layered candy cake , yummy from start to finnish . a light , quick read intended to be thought provoking in either its mildest form or more serious , good bones creates a batter of cookie dough complementing her unique sense of style and outlook on our society
1990,james moseley was the stereotypical rich orphan trust-fund kid , inheriting millions while still in college . he promptly left college and attached himself to a shady , indiana-jones-style south american graverobber . the graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying saucer myth , then only a few years old . moseley was sent crisscrossing the us to interview anyone and everyone who had made contributions to that myth in the period 1947 - 1954. the book never materialized , but moseley was left with extensive notes , and the indelible and accurate impression that , apart from a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they did n't recognize , and would have been expected to if it were anything familiar , the majority of the mythmakers were , as my old grandma used to say , " crazy as a betsy-bug . " over the years moseley kept his hand in , meeting and interviewing anyone who came onto the scene in what he sometimes calls the field , other times ( more accurately ) " ufoology . " he edited and published a long series of saucer fanzines and newsletters and still publishes one to this day . he met everyone and he shrewdly sized up everyone . he organized many flying saucer conventions and seems to have attended most of the others . here 's his information-packed account of about 48 years in the field , and there is no more accurate word-picture anywhere in print in english ( i 've looked ! ) of the classic early 1950s contactees led by george adamski , on to the 1960s abductees led by betty hill , on to the growth of the crashed-saucer myth from its humble beginnings with the 1949 scully hoax , on to the full-blown roswell hoax of 1985 - 90 , and on to the " supernatural " abduction stories of the 1990s . moseley was an eyewitness to the birth of many hoaxes , a few of which he perpetrated himself . highly recommended , as a true insider 's look at this nearly 60 year-old and seemingly immortal myth of " things seen in the sky .
1991,robert allen 's previous book , multiple streams of income , is excellent and i ca n't say enough good things about it . this one was a major disappointment in comparison . he talks about the same rehashed internet marketing strategies that everyone else does . creating email lists , newsletters , blah , blah , blah.. . the most disappointing thing about robert allen - - and i lost so much respect for him over this - - is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast . what 's stupid about the whole thing , and demonstrates that he 's a snakeoil salesman scam artist , is that what he 's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the internet...so how do you make money on the internet ? according to robert allen , by selling courses showing people how to make money on the internet is the only way to make money on the internet . that 's a scam ! how does he sleep at night ? do n't buy this book . it 's a waste of money
1992,looks nice.. . but beware ! installed norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office . as soon as i did that our accounting system ( peachtree ) started to lock up a few times a day . even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up . i 've now uninstalled norton 360 on the server pc and that seems to have solved the problem . i wish now that i had just upgraded from norton internet security 2005 to 2007... never again .
1993,she is a little poser ! ! ! kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies . wearing that stupid little diaper , always so happy . she wo n't be so happy when i kick her between the legs . also , those stupid little cowboy boots . she really sucks . i 'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry . that shown her ! ! ! the movie was good , but she stinks
1994,as my brother said when flipping through this book , " if girls start acting like guys then what do we need them for ? " why should you pretend to be someone or something you 're not to get a guy ? if someone dumps you because you like mushy love songs , cry at sad movies , like babies and puppies , or because you have embarrassing girl products in your medicine cabinet , he is n't worth it anyway ! and why on earth would you sleep with someone who did n't love you enough to want you around the next morning ? " think like a guy " does n't guarantee you a perfect relationship anymore than the rules or stop getting dumped or mars and venus or any of the other ridiculous relationship books that have been popular over the last few years . be yourself . if a man ca n't deal with that , then he is n't the right one for you
1995,you can tell your life is really pathetic when ghosts have to show you how to live . but that is what happens to cosmo topper , in the charming " topper " and its equally charming sequel " topper returns . " it 's basically your typical screwball comedy ( complete with cary grant ) , but with an injection of supernatural pranking and murder mystery . in other words , it 's loads of fun . george and marion kirby ( cary grant , constance bennett ) love fun , partying until clubs kick them out , and generally not taking life seriously . so it 's a shock to them when they die in a car accident , and linger on as ghosts . apparently they have not done any good deeds to go to the great beyond . so when george 's boss , cosmo topper ( roland young ) , crashes his new car in the same spot , the kirbys take him under their wing . poor cosmo is stodgy and timid , with a domineering wife who schedules his day down to the minute . so it 's up to the kirbys to show the poor man how to live life and have fun , but their good deed rapidly gets away from them.. . and most sequels stink , but goofy murder mystery " topper returns " is just as funny as the first movie . instead of a ghostly screwball , this time it 's a spoof of " haunted house " stories , with a nod to hitchcock 's " rebecca . " ann carrington ( carole landis ) is returning to her ancestral home and inheritance , with cheeky pal gail ( joan blondell ) in tow . but after the girls switch bedrooms , someone murders gail . confused , she drifts over to the house of cosmo topper ( roland young ) , whose car she hijacked earlier in the day . gail blackmails topper into helping her discover who murdered her , and who is trying to kill ann. now the unfortunate topper must somehow solve the mystery , despite a small army of creepy servants , a house full of secret passages and vicious seals , and his upset wife searching high and low for him.. . based on thorne smith 's novels , " topper " and " topper returns " even had a spinoff tv series , which was nowhere near as good as the movies . and those movies are charming and still fresh , especially if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories . but it 's the little touches that make this movie hilarious ; for example , there 's george laughing on a chandelier , and gail chugging champagne when she discovers her own dead body . not to mention that vicious seal . the comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in the second film , but no less entertaining . but at the same time , these movies are graced by tender moments between george and marion , and a truly exquisite scene where gail 's ghost wanders out the window into the sky . and i 'm still not sure how that invisible-person-under-the-covers shot was done , especially with the primitive special effects of the 1940s . roland young is the star of the piece - - his topper is timid , halting , and has his day scheduled down to the minute . not a single spark of sponteneity . grant comes across like a trickster god , and has wonderful chemistry with bennett . and blondell is simply charming as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl . " topper " and " topper returns " are decades old , but are perfect examples of hollywood classics . charming , chipper and hilarious
1996,i was having a problem with over-eating and eating when i was n't hungry and as a result , gained quite a bit of weight , and felt awful . i 've only been using this product for three days , but already my portion size has shrunk immensely and my energy is way up . i have n't felt jittery or shaky . i feel better than i have in months . i would recommend this to those who also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop some un-needed weight
1997,this dvd is the authorotizzle on the technizzle . fo schizzle
1998,this was by far the best genero / kenzie novel of the series . i loved this book . everything about it . in this one , you really got to see the emotional side of bubba . made him more likeable . the storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down . i was happy to see angie and patrick back together . the ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book . i 'm scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why lehane has n't published another . it 's been 5 years . i will be watching for it
1999,mark l . sirower 's thought-provoking and complex book is actually a critically acclaimed academic study that challenges the reasoning behind corporate acquisitions . pointing out that acquisitions usually devalue the acquiring companies ( a loss from which they rarely recover ) , sirower delves into management fundamentals and mathematical analyses to get to the bottom of merger and acquisition problems . three detailed appendices feature plenty of financial calculations , performance measures and data from various corporate acquisitions to back up his assertions . we [...] recommend this book to those involved in mergers and acquisitions and to other readers intrigued by the inside view of this " carnivorous quest .
2000,this works fairly well for me . it easily downloads the capital gains from microsoft money , the interviews are fairly straightforward . however there are a few areas ( like foreign tax credit ) where it should be automated but isn't . but on the whole it does a nice job , they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item .
2001,i 'm satisfied with the product . i seem to be getting the protection on my pc ; for the cost of product you ca n't go wrong
2002,this town feels so typical at first - - the suburban couple , husband with misc . job and wife who 's good at parties . the gem in cheever 's writing is to render these people and their neighbors with the true unique humanity and quirks we all possess . sometimes cheever 's work can seem stereotypical , everyone drinking gin and having weird suicidal urges . this book , though , is a masterful blend of truly normal people and the creepy backstory that lives next door
2003,i have been following gospel since the early 80s . i am a big fan of contemporary gospel and shei atkins defines how r&p gospel should sound . trinitee 5:7 along with dawkins & dawkins have done a great job so far , but shei atkins covers it all- -relationships ( cheating , divorce , pre-marital sex ) ; worship ; hymns ; enocuragement ; you name it and she has a song for it . i just bought the cd and i ca n't take it out of my cd player ! ! her voice is so annointed and unique ! she can easily give beyonce , erykah badu and mary blige a run for their money ! she can easily be played on mainstream radio and everyone would be bobbin ' their heads to it- -yet she has no problem mentioning jesus in any of her songs ! for those christians who are looking for something that they can groove and relax too ( with some anointing ) please buy this cd- -i promise you that you wo n't be disappointed ! i can literally listen to every song on this cd over and over again
2004,as promised , this product was sent brand new and arrived quicker than expected . my brother loves soccer and thoroughly enjoyed this as a present for christmas
2005,sure , the pacing is slow compared to today 's hyper / cyber entertainments , but antonioni 's visuals are still incomparable . scene after scene resembles nothing so much as a matisse canvas , and the final shot is a stunner . lovely , achingly felt picture
2006,ok i gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them . i do have them on my laptop so i guess that kinda works . whats great about it is the price . 30 bucks for 40 years of comics.....get real ! ! ! i did have some install problems at first like others have but when i took the disc out and reloaded it it fixed itself . i think it was a adobe update but it did it for me so no biggie . my only problem now is when am i going to find time to read all of the issues . oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you . highly recomended if you love comics
2007,i ordered 2 of these . only 1 came with the ac plug . that was disappointing
2008,i should have left this review a long time ago . i could kick myself for buying it , thinking it was a film , not a religous object . if you critisize this film amongst religious radicals , you risk being burned at the stake , an act of love to purify your soul . this film , as a film , disregarding the topic , is a dog . a cheap " b " grade , blood spurting , flesh flying horror flick in aramaic with sub-titles . i could go on for an hour , but wo n't bother
2009,rap music today is a tragic lack of creativity . its not real hip hop . this album , brings back the good feeling that is real hip hop . honestly , the light is a song that never gets old , thats real . if you do n't have this album , get it .
2010," the player " provided a trip back in time to what it was like playing ball around the turn of the century through the times of the first world war . to understand what mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing . not only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control , he realized that he was a role model for others , not only the young kids that idolized him , but the everyday american worker . to know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field , his charity work , volunteering for wwi at the age of 37 , gives us a better insight to the individual . the book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game , before the black sox scandal . he knew it was going on , tried to warn others , but no one would listen . a great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time . one that is unfortunatelly forgotten by too many in today 's game
2011,i have this program on a 30-day demo . it might be ok if i did n't mind my computer becoming almost unusable . i tried to run the system virus scan , as recommended , but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it could n't seem to get past . i skipped the file , but then it quickly got stuck again . the " time remaining " said it would take 4 days to complete , so i cancelled that scan . it has a learning mode that initally blocks everything . apparently , this program has no brain . for example , i have the live search toolbar installed in outlook . it had to ask me if it was ok to run that dll file . in fact , each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run . do n't even get me started on the quickbooks and internet explorer problems . which is what it would n't let those programs do , even after they had been run and i repeated clicked " allow " over and over . twice today it got so slow running ie that it finally crashed the computer so bad that i had to do a hard re-boot . if you have it checking ports on your computer , almost nothing would run or download on ie . so , i 'm going to demo a few more , but it 's probably back to windows live onecare , which i had the past year . it just does n't seem to do much ( no long list of features ) , but it also does n't jam everthing else up
2012,there have been innumerable motorhead collections over the years , but this is one of the few that attempts to mix old with the new . on this collection , all the classics are present , and some newer material is thrown in as well . unfortunately , there are some throw-away tracks , mainly the girlscool and headgirl tracks . ( to be honest , these tracks are pretty much worthless . ) some live tracks are meshed in and fit well , and the newer songs help to add some variety to the old-scool stuff . i would recommend this collection to listeners looking to get a nice , cheap collection of some of motorhead 's best just for the sake of getting into the band . but if you 're wanting the prime collection of older material , save up some extra dough and buy " no remorse " or " stone deaf forever .
2013,while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book , it reminds me of the story , " the emperor has no clothes " . yes , choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes , the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying . the " flipping back and forth " was not accomplished in a smooth , flowing manner . in addition , the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved . the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived . it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone
2014,this film had a powerful effect on me . 95% of the people i know do n't read books . i met a millionaire not long ago , who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life . lady di was reported never to have read anything - - - except perhaps fashion mags . my children hardly read , and their husbands and wives certainly don't . my ex-wife never read anything . her father thought ulysses was a dirty book . i stopped watching television in 1980 , and i own 10 , 000 books - - - but not fahrenheit 451 , which i 'd read about 45 years ago . this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury 's text , but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear , and with a very solid punch to the plexus . the manner in which it is written , played and directed , added to its impact . this world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us . the style was strange , but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal . people live and work like automated morons . they ca n't think for themselves , and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied . they ca n't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind : in fact , present them with an idea , or attempt to initiate a discussion , and they 'll often become angry . some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts . ludicrous suggestions : remake it with mad mel gibson . have infantile spielberg direct it . bulk it out with computerised sfx . these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets , and many of them seem unable to understand their own language , let alone write it , or spell it . this is a memorable film , for those whose memories still function . unlike the captain of the firemen
2015,i have used this product for about 5 years . it is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else . i especially would recommend it to any small business owner
2016,this book is best used for viewing its selection of master drawings many of which are superb . however , its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo-intellectualizations . it should be noted that this book was not written by hale ; it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of hale 's classic , " drawing lessons from the great masters . " instead , this book loses itself in unimportant , erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle , confuse , frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader . it greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory
2017,i just installed autoroute 2007. there is a feature in autoroute where you can display various places of interest on the map . in this version , for some installations you can not hide restaurants . this has been reported on the microsoft uk autoroute community website . i loaded the program on a second computer with the same result . both systems run window xp pro . this means for certain cities , like paris , at certain magnifications , the map is completely cluttered with small green squares which indicate the location of a restaurant . microsoft only indicates that they will enter this bug into the work request for the next version of autoroute . they also say earlier versions were not affected . you may want to buy 2007 but check out your ability to show / hide all of the items of interest right away and be prepared to be dissappointed . i am going to try finding autoroute 2006 for sale
2018,once again mr. updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women - love , lust , betrayal , self doubt . villages relates owen 's life as only john updike can . the last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book , but i will certainly recommend it to all my friends
2019,i am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the dragon software over the last eight to 10 years . i was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product . however , i now own version 9 and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product . if i were still practicing law , i would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice . because i did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable , i purchased a wireless microphone ( by nady - which i have also reviewed ) which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program . the program required less than one-half hour of setup although i have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns . this dictation is much more accurate than my typing , and i have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well . my only regret is that i purchased the basic program , rather than an advanced program . now that i see how well the product works , i wish that i had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just english as i am fluent in spanish and have a growing acquaintance with french . incidentally , i dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send e-mails , as well as dictate letters , memoranda and outlines in microsoft word . it may be relevant to note that i am not using an underpowered computer system . i have an amd dual core system with 2 mb of ram . i am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional
2020,this is a great dvd . i bought it for my son , who has special needs . he attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor , but has never been able to figure out how to do the electric slide or macarena . neither my husband nor i knew how to do these dances either . i played the " party line dances " dvd , and asked my son to follow shawn 's instructions . pretty soon he was moving along with shawn , and doing very well . and by joining a few of our son 's practices , my husband and i quickly picked up the dance moves too . my son now participates fully , and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions
2021,paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music . however , content on his latest project , " white sand " is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums . the artist collaborations on " white sand " make it tempting to purchase , but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility ( smooth , latin or r&b ) are lacking . overall it is still a cd worth paying for
2022,i got this product to help me sleep and it did not work for me . i used to take some pain killer / sleep aid made by members mark and that worked great , but i no longer need the pain killer . i bought this and have tried it 3 times now , and i ca n't quite explain it but it did not make me tired . it made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired , plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times i used it . not only did it not make me drowsy , i could n't sleep and i woke up several times during the night . i think i would have done better without it . but everyone reacts to drugs differently , so try at your own risk
2023,if you 're a professional photographer , you can probably ignore this review . but then you probably wo n't be thinking about buying this lens anyway , as you 'll be off to purchase a nice l series . however , if - like me - you just happen to have a nice canon digital rebel camera ( or equivalent ) and enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens will probably work out very well for you . i 've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks , and it has performed very much as expected . for the price , it 's perfect for a go-everywhere lens . a few main points . okay , it 's not the best image quality . even on low / medium iso it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive canon lenses . it struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit , but for well-lit outdoor shoots it 's works very well . of course , it would be nice to have a nice l series with is , but if you ca n't afford that then this is a very good value lens . not for the real professionals , but great if you do n't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and , let 's face it , who does n't want a but more zoom
2024,terrible product . printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly . i 've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens . even though i have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement , which i have had less than a year , kodak support says it cannot be fixed by me and i need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks . a new one sells for $99 and the price is dropping fast . i told kodak support i would not send it back to them , spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye . i further notified kodak that i would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill . also , i 've heard that the recommended fix ( which does not work , by the way ) , unplugging the unit to reset , will cause the color cartridge light to illuminate prematurely . with the cost of paper and cartridges , this last insult makes this printer one to avoid . 1 star because when it does print the prints look good , but , man , the aggravation to get this thing to work correctly is not worth any price . rushed to the market place without enough reliability testing on an unsuspecting public . total junk from a venerable name desperate for a hit product .
2025,a few years ago , i had the pleasure of meeting pam munoz ryan at a summer arts children 's storytelling forum held at california state university - fresno . she read the book to parents , teachers , and students who attended the conference . i was amazed on the writing , culture , and illustrations that she used for this book . the novel serves as a tale of her childhood spending time with her family at her grandmother 's house . overall , the story teaches children the value of traditions , family , and heritage . in short , " mice and beans " is a good book to read
2026,mercury contamination is a very big deal especially if you are going to take a product " for life " , are pregnant or a child . many fish oil products have mercury contamination and are not filtered . is this product mercury free ? ? so far the only product that was certified mercury free was available from my medical doctor by a prescription .
2027,if you liked whyte 's previous sophomoric efforts , you 'll love this . in addition to being the same dumb , hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books , this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler : in no real way does the story get advanced . arthur begins as a baby , and ends as a small boy . there are adventures , but nothing important happens . as usual , in whyte 's books , the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil , and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters . with all the ( totally ahistorical ) democratic rhetoric , merlin 's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot . anyone who would read this , i guess , has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and does n't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence , caricatures who never grow or change , and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship . so go for it . but please , if you want something exciting that will also make you think , look at the really good arthurian efforts out there- -gillian brandshaw , a.a. attanasio , or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few. .
2028,spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health ; eat nothing but mcdonald 's fast food for 30 days . the result ; his health gets ruined . while spurlock 's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the lancet , it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health . i rarely eat mcdonalds ( though i enjoy the odd coke ) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in australia , as it is worldwide . the strength of mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer . mcdonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food , and made ray kroc ( its founder ) a fortune . i do n't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil , because they are multinational corporations ; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers , as well as shareholders . we happily buy coke , mcdonalds , cigarettes , and many other things obviously bad for our health , and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad . in our individualistic culture , we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control , and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists . however , the rocketing levels of obesity , especially amoung children , are of great concern , and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical . we need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction , otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents . spurlock 's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously , and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence
2029,while this certainly is n't the best pearl jam concert ever it is n't the worst either . the first disc starts a little slow..but you ca n't argue with getting to hear song 's like " in my tree " and " faithfull " . highlights are : love boat captain...a nice opener . one of the best of riot act song 's for sure . in my tree , one of , if not my favorite pj songs . not quite as rocking as the 2000 tour performances but still great . gimme some truth . maybe not a technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt and passionate . good john lennon cover . even flow . always great . spin the black circle...the band starts to get more into the show after this rocking performance . thumbing my way...just a great slow song . breath . in my opinion the best performance of the show...just great . crown of thorns . i really like this version of the song...played well whether you think ed should sing it or not . baba o'reilly . the classic " who " song . a great performance . just try to sit still during this one . i would reccomend this dvd to anyone that is a pearl jam fan already but if you 're not then i would start with some of their studio albums first .
2030,jigga is incredibly hot on this album beanie is good to great . memphis bleek , is really good on this album , but is overshadowed . his " 534 " shows how good he is , this album does not . overall as an album it does a good job of showing off roc a fella , but not to much about the dynasty
2031,i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e. same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product
2032,this book is a quick read and a great introduction to artificial life . it combines something of the science , the personalities and the history of this field . for general readers with some technical sophistication it affords an opportunity to broaden one 's horizons without too much of a mathematical stretch ; for computer scientists who are thinking of their own research it can give a general idea of some of the accomplishments in the field and a place to start delving into the original research papers . read it and enjoy the future
2033,...else if michigan was on vinyl i would have worn it out by now . illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of sufjan stevens , and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date . however the subtle spendour of the earlier michigan has ousted it as my favourite . perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than illinois , but more soulful and beautiful . ultimately it 's the one i 'd take to the proverbial desert island . there 's not a single track in this 74 minute cd that i 'd want to skip or drop from my mp3 playlist , but highlights for me are romulus ( gentle and heartbreaking ) , sleeping bear ( musically gorgeous ) , and vito 's ordination song ( like being gently hugged ) . p.s. so often the ' bonus tracks ' on a cd can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my cd ( marching band and pickerel lake ) are both excellent .
2034,and i am not just talking about weight loss products . i took one pill....one pill ! within a few minutes , i was curled up around the toilet crying because i needed to throw up so badly but i couldn't . i had n't drunk anything but one glass of water with it , and yet , i was peeing all day . i was nauseus....my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me . i did n't want to move , but i would have to go to the bathroom to pee , and would carry around a trash can with me just in case i finally could throw up . i would not wish these symptoms on anyone , not even my worst enemy . that was probably the worst sickness i have ever had
2035,one of the most compelling events of the release of kenneth lonergan 's you can count on me is that it gave visibility to mark ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who , unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash , lives of life of unattached agony and isolation . he 's a loner and a drifter , medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships . his sister sammy , played wonderfully by laura linney , reacts to the same tragedy by being , in many ways , an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom . two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash . this film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight , the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another . the ride is never easy in this film . no easy answers are given . just as important , this film , which deals with the pain of loss , never descends into the maudlin hallmark movie sap that other films would . balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight , lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss . amazingly , he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic . matthew broderick , for example , plays a hilarious role of sammy 's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank . the conflict between him and sammy leads to a plot point that i 'll let you discover in the film . but most of all , this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such an endearing , sympathetic , sometimes infuriating character . you wo n't forget him
2036,just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted . never used . returned it
2037,i enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find encarta a useful tool . i 'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events .
2038," horizon " was a turning point in the recording career of the carpenters- -a more sophisticated sound more suited to karen 's rich and warm voice . but the album was rather short , and some of the songs just were n't up to the standards expected by their fans , which was reflected in the sales of the album , which was their slowest selling album up to that point . the opening " aurora " and the closing " eventide " ( the same melody with different lyrics ) nicely bookend the album , and aurora provides the first hint that this was not the average carpenters album . " only yesterday " follows ; this beautiful and uptempo song begins as a dolorous , downbeat ballad before segueing into the cheerful refrain . the cover of " desperado " is well done , but ultimately it is lost between the flashy tracks before and after it . " please mr. postman " is infectuously happy fluff ; it has absolutely no depth , but is irresistable while it 's playing and will have you singing along with karen . the big-band era " i can dream , ca n't i ? " reveals the new depths of karen 's voice , and the small jazz combo ensures that she is the focus of the listener . the third and final single from this album , " solitaire " begins the second half of the album on a ( metaphorical ) high note . the remaining full tracks ( " happy " , " i 'm caught between goodbye and i love you " , and " love me for what i am " ) are all less-than-captivating songs that greatly benefit from karen 's reading and richard 's arrangements
2039,based on the description , i expected this to be a davinci code knock-off , but gave it a shot since i recieved a free copy . comparing labyrinth to the davinci code do it injustice ; this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it 's own right . i enjoyed the characters , plot , and switching between the past and present . i 'm not sure it has literary value ( i would n't argue that the davinci code does , either ) , but it 's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow
2040,in the commencement mr. utterson and his cousin mr. richard enfield were walking throughout london . the men go by a mysterious cellar door , and then mr. enfield talked about a story that ensue here previously . also later in the book utterson work to help dr. jekyll from being brung into the ghastly tribulations of mr. hydes . one year later , edward hyde viciously murders sir danvers carew by thrashing him to death with a cane . i did not like this book because it was a high level booklover so i could not concentrate . i 'd propose this book for high scholar for that reason , and if you 're a person who reads allot . the genre was good because it was sci-fi and it seems sci-fi is a little more addicting . the author is a pretty well known writer his name is robert louis stevenson .
2041,maybe the most engaging documentary ever made . brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry , producer robert evans . giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that i could only describe as psychedelic . being a film fanatic for the last 43 years i was shocked and ashamed to find that i had not heard of robert evans . in all my reading of credits over the years i had somehow missed his name . i had remembered seeing william castle 's name at the beginning of rosemary 's baby but not evan's . then , at finding out that he was the driving force behind love story , the godfather , the godfather pt.2 , chinatown and one of my personal favorites the president 's analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good , well i was just dumbfounded . and these are just a fraction of the films he 's produced . of course he did n't start as a producer . he had been in women 's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today . while lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by norma shearer , lauching his career into show biz . it seems he knows everybody and i mean everybody . after watchng this extraordinary film i called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality . i queried , " have you ever heard of robert evans ? " anxiously awaiting a " no " so i could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity . he replied , " you mean bob evans . " yes indeed , it seems he knows everybody . my father had come across him in his days as a buyer for macy's . i asked , " do you know what he does now ? " " he 's some sort of movie director or something now , is n't he . " , dad answered . i bought him the audiobook . evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook , both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name . his voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess . he also lent his voice to the short-lived , hysterically irreverent cartoon series kid notorious that still airs on comedy central . all in all , whether you know evans or not this is a fascinating , beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than thalberg 's and selznick 's combined . the story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on . this is a must see for anyone interested in tinseltown . ps:i do n't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc . what a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody . ask your dad . who knows ?
2042,tony kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of & quot ; the best&quot ; pilots around . his use of case studies of real pilots and real situations includes examples from the military , commercial , and geneal aviation communities . in short , the book is useful for any pilot whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed as a senior airline captain . for many pilots , it will reinforce what they already know and practice but for many , it will provide the opportunity to become & quot ; old&quot ; pilots . if you fly , read the book
2043,phil jackson groupie and sometime espn.com writer charley rosen turns in a fun , but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life . he develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot . however , rosen 's personal oddities drag the book down . rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting , urination , defacation , etc. at times , the book reads like an immature third grader 's delight . my roommates and i all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable , but charley rosen is a really weird guy
2044,this album was so good to hear when it came out . i like every song on here but my favorites are " still dre " , " the watcher " , " xxplosive " , " what 's the difference " and " forget about dre . those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like . recommend this album highly to rap fans . buy this album you have nothing to loose because its dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic
2045,when yours truly was eleven and in reading class , " incident " was required reading . this had to be the most ridiculous book that i ever had the displeasure of reading . i mean , the boy is cared for by a badger ! badgers are mean and ornery critters that do n't much like people or even their own kind . i did not believe it at eleven , nor do i now . also , eckert certainly did n't need to include some of those descriptions . was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring 's excrement ? what eleven-year-old wants to read about that ? so , for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really did n't want to know about in the first place : this book 's for you
2046,the product is very good , do not misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt when we bought it ten years ago : the curls tend to stay put less time compared with the former hair curler tubes . but still , we strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes . it 's a good buy
2047,i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures . i did n't want to spend a lot of money , however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use . not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working . however , when it did work every single picture was blurry . there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . it is being returned
2048,this album grabbed my attention from the first measure . thick and heavy , this is not like any blues album i 've ever heard . very atypical for hidalgo as well . this one is probably an acquired taste - one for the truly hard core blues fan . the sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start , and the more i listen to it , the more i like it . i can only hope there 's a houndog 2 in the works. .
2049,ok , this definately looks very promising . i saw a version of this on the flix channel about three nights ago . it was good . if that is any indication on how good the show is then this collector 's edition box set of the older series should be better . i am going to purchase this soon . once i purchase it , i will let you know how good it really is . i 'll give another review once i purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes . a month ago is when i really learned of this series so i am truly looking forward to watching this series . goddess anjanee :
2050,this is one of the silliest books i have read for a long time . it could be categorised as belonging to the same genre of " action fantasy " as a number of hollywood films . examples of the rules of reality being abandoned : the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter , and the author even notes at one point how it 's pitch dark outside , yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other . people spend minutes in freezing water , yet pop out none the worse for the wear . two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a " spaceship " has been found there , shouted once through the radio . a 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically , nor , apparently , mentally . a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years , but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it . the stupidity goes on and on , but that 's perhaps enough to give a taste . there are perhaps people who do not care about any of this , but i do n't enjoy books whose author does n't have one bit of interest in any sort of realism
2051,my wife got this cd for me because i like the music from the movie cast away . she saw the words & quot ; cast away&quot ; in large and prominent print . she saw the picture of tom hanks , very large . she assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on the cd . in hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the cd . i guess the producers of this cd did n't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people would n't waste time returning it . if you had it listed in the rate column , i would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star
2052,he adquirido este flash para completar mi cámara evolt e-500 y considero que es la combinación perfecta . se requieren de conocimientos adicionales de iluminación y fotografía para obtener las mayores prestaciones que ofrecen ambos equipos . altamente recomendado
2053,the gs150 's performance is as-advertised . terrific colour rendering , thanks to its 3-chip configuration . the camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings , making it even more usable . love the joystick ! still find it hard to believe that panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package . final score : engineering 1 , customer service 0 early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem , which causes faint , red , horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions . despite the fact this has been widely ( if unofficially ) reported by gs150 owners around the world , these same owners have noted that panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists . thankfully , the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician . better still , gs150 owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from september 2005 onward are alright . look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with ' h5 ' or higher . you can also read all about this at pana3ccduser dot com
2054,tom delonge is at it again with a new band and a new album . even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from boxcar racer , angels and airwaves managed to have a completely different sound . they dropped the more punk rock tone of boxcar racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of rock . the first released single " the adventure " is quite enjoyable and even though i have n't checked too deeply into it , i think it 's the theme song for nbc 's studio 60. besides , how can you go wrong with an album that 's gone double platinum in the uk and gold in canada
2055,this is the best book . i was writing a book about my son who has si dysfunction . he is 23 years old now . i was in barnes and noble looking for another book when i found this . i was blown away . i never knew there was a book like this . i could have really used this book when marcus was little . it is so wonderful . i opened it and started reading about my son . my book is called what 's wrong with my child ? struggling with sensory integration dysfunction . it is only a mother 's story of how my child coped with this thing . it is not meant to be a book like carol stock kranowitz's . her book is wonderful . anyone who has any questions about their child who has si dysfunction . this book is it . shelly r . wilso
2056,i use this product all the time . it was becoming hard to find in department stores , but i found it available and cheaper online . i 'm very happy .
2057,i 'm still learning to use this camera and all the features . so far it is amazing . i 've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots . i use the auto mode a lot and it works great . the zoom is amazing . i love that it tells me when i am focused . also it has great battery life . i 'm very happy with this camera
2058,i have been using this product now for almost a year . the only reason i insist using it is because i feel really bad for wasting my money . first , this is not worth $300 bucks . there are only still pictures and sound . no movies or any fancy graphics , so why the price ? second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences . third , the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all . you keep memorizing thins like " the boy is under the airplane " or " the ball is on the boy 's head " . initially i thought , well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad . but then i took a look at the last lessons ; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue . i cannot recommend you another course because i spent so much in this one that i do not want to try again and get disappointed . do n't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like i was . this is definitively not worth 300 dollars . it is not even useful for basic converstion . i have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library . ah , and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar ..
2059,i highly recommend this super wide angle lens for anyone wanting to take landscape pictures , buildings or lots of other stuff ! it is so different than the standard kit lens ( 18-55 ) . you wo n't be sorry when you start learning all the possibilities of the extraordinary lens
2060,normally i might wait to install a new software upgrade , but i just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use office 2007 with the new vista operating system . i was wrong . you would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software . but after a month of using office 2007 , you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release . microsoft should be ashamed . i do n't know the root cause of my problems , but i have to stress that i am running a clean install of office 2007 on vista , so there should n't be any software conflicts or issues . so what are my issues ? the list is long : - - my biggest concern is that ms word constantly hangs and stalls . it can making editing a document very painful . i suspect the problem is when i put images or visio diagrams into a document . but that is something the old ms word was able to do without an issue . oddly , if i have a colleague open the document and save it out in word 2003 , the problem goes away ! what ? ! it 's killing my productivity . - - when ever i cut and paste from an old document , word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds . and often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire . i keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things . this never happened in the old word . this is another time killer . - - every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders . uh oh ! i have to completely restart my computer to see my email again . - - outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send - - they look like a mess . it is because outlook 2007 does not render html correctly since it uses the word engine , not internet explorer to display email . i have no idea why microsoft did this , but they have got to fix it . - - many of the issues in the old word 2003 still have n't been fixed . if you place an image , it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly . why ca n't they solve this one ? - - while most office programs have the new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 do not . so you have to remember how to use two interfaces . could n't microsoft find the time and money to update all its programs ? give me a break . - - on a few occassions in visio 2007 , my files have failed to save correctly . at first i thought this must have been my fault , but it 's happened to me a few times and ca n't be a coincidence . a few times i 've gotten an error message and lost my work . ug. - - word and excel 2007 use a completely new file format . so anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed ( which is n't likely the case ) . to get around this , you can save it down to a 2003 file format , but then you end up with two files on your hard drive - - one in the new format and one in the old format . what a pain ! also , there definitely seems to be an issue with office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could be the cause of many of my problems , but there is no way i can avoid using old files . they should have worked harder on compatibility . there are good things about the new 2007. i do like the new interface design and the new features in outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar . but i do n't think it 's fair that microsoft released a product so full of serious , serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work . i did n't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and do n't think the public should have to suffer . surely they can afford to do better ! new addition to my review : today i discovered that i can no longer paste excel charts into word like i used to . when i try , the chart goes in , but any bars / lines disappear .
2061,i must say i was dissapointed with those 2 stories . first story is so far from reality ( i know , i know , sometimes we want to get away-but not that far ! ! ! ) i could n't read even half of the 2nd story...it was written very poorly . sometimes i felt like something just was n't enough , at times opposite - like it was way too much ! anyway , i would n't recomend bying this book. .
2062,i bought the goggles and was excited by the look . they are kind of " riddick " like . they had disappoiinting performance when i rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face . they did float and so i found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened . i gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing . they definately are not for extreme sports . they are also too big for casual use as sun glasses .
2063,if you have had any exposure to good literature , you will find this novel nearly insufferable . the symbolism is cliche , narrative style predictable and unoriginal , and the book as a whole is this woman 's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read . if she had any creative ability , she could use her family history as a starting point , but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh . dull , dry , predicatable , callow , and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student
2064,i purchased this orange humidifer and promptly returned it . i already have the penguin which is also by this company...and that one worked perfectly . i do n't know if it is because of the design...but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running . you have to constantly shake it to get it going again . obviously a manufacturer error . i must say it is completely adorable and asthetically a complete pleasure to look at . my kids wanted me to keep it because it was that cute . but , it just did n't work
2065,no doubt about it , from start to finish , this is a classic for anybody 's collection . i can remember back in the spring of ' 93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today . this was rap music at it 's best from spice 1 to dj quik . there will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods . so add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap , west coast fan ( like myself ) , or just want to hear a great soundtrack
2066,i really enjoyed this book . i could pore over the fashions , the interior decoration - it satisfied my desire to see all the details ! at the same time , i got a sense of the passage of time in virginia and vanessa 's lives . read as a companion to any of woolf 's novels , i think the book would also convey a sense of the writing process . it evokes the time and place beautifully , and the text is not intrusive : the images are allowed to take centre stage as works of art in their own right . fine choice , sweetpea
2067,i teach presentation skills , so i 'm always on the lookout for things that make powerpoint better . i 've tried and recommended other software in the past , but none of them have the power of ovation . this is an outstanding piece of software . the visual effects are stunning , and it 's so easy to use that a child could learn it in a few minutes . powerpoint is boring , and everyone 's presentations look the same . not any more ! full-motion backgrounds and effects really jazz up your presentations , and they have over 100 professional-looking business themes available . see their website ( seriousmagic dot com ) for a demonstration of what it can do . all you have to do is drag and drop your powerpoint presentation on the ovation icon , choose a theme and the effects , and voila ! - a new presentation ! the current version 1.0 can not process embedded video or audio files , but they say that will be fixed with the first patch within the next month or two . despite that shortcoming , this is the best powerpoint enhancement available - heads and shoulders above the competitors
2068,my 8 year old daughter brought this book home from her school library and was excited by many of the projects . from a parent 's point of view it was great to have a book with achievable craft projects which yield items the child can be proud of and parents will happily display . i 'm ordering it now
2069,i needed a document management system . after looking for software , there only appeared to be paperport . i had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files . i guessed a large number meant 2500+ at least . this concerned me , so i called pre-sales at scansoft , and asked if it was slow with a large number of files . he was not sure ! so he told me to call technical . i called technical , and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me . i asked if he was reading the scansoft website and he said yes , so i hung up . obviously i read their site for an answer , and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it . i got the software . basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software . it worked well , and i thought ok , expensive for what it is , when windows explorer and scanning software ( usually free ) would nearly do most of it , but then after around 560 pdfs , it started running very slow . i thought it was my machine so installed it and the pdfs on a new vaio 1.7mhz , 1 gig laptop . same problem . if you click to view the pdf then hit the return back , it takes 12 seconds ! so if you view a document , it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the paperport desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds ! ! ! completely unusuable ! if you have less than 500 files , it is maybe expensive software , but for more than 500 do not waste you money . it runs so slow you can not use it . i wonder how scansoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files
2070,the philips digital frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that i 've gotten . the resolution and picture quality superb , and the sleek outer design is an additional plus . also , the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord , which is very convenient . as another reviewer said , you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want . it would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a blackberry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to . also , i would like to see philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well , that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the usb flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card . thank you
2071,the humor is definitely not in the book - reviews and summaries use the word " hilarity " however , i did not come across any situation that i would classify as even funny , not to mention hilarious . i thoroughly enjoyed her first novel , pink slip , however , this one seemed depressing . the two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story . the plot seemed to be very slow - the whole story took place in a matter of days , but really , nothing took place in the book . all in all , they bought a house . i would pass on this for better reads elsewhere
2072,i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market . edain mccoy , who has written some wonderful new age material , strikes an off-putting note in this one . the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation , but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements . in several of her spreads she conveys that a card 's placement at a certain point in the spread " may or may not " mean some karmic element at play . the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define . therefore , when a card " may or may not " mean something , that interpretation could significantly change on whether you " may or may not " interpret it that way , leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card 's meaning . tarot cards are intuitive , not rational , and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult . imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position " may or may not " be the root of the issue . these spreads speak very clearly to the author , but not so to the reader . i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives , but the explanations are too ambiguous .
2073,this product is so cool . whatever your situation is , if you have a lot of digital pictures , then i recommend going out and getting an sd card...preferably up to 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , for use this with this product . even if your camera does n't use sd , you can plop the sd card right into the picture frame and upload photos from your computer to the card ! it 's like a little computer , this frame . another big suggestion i have is to find a program online that resizes your photos to the dimensions of the frame ( photo size explained in other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this will take photos down from its original size ( e.g. 1.8 mb ) to a smaller size ( e.g. 500kb ) . this will let your store dramatically more photos . so far i have fit over 1700 photos in about 430mb worth of the 1gb sd card that i have ! the picture quality is very good and the frame can swivel to basically any angle and could be used horizontally or vertically . plus , it is a philips , which is a great brand . i have a philips hd tv as well and it is my baby...i love it . this is a great present for anyone ! how can you go wrong with a picture frame that replaces its picture any time you want
2074,i wanted to buy this for my daughter . i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby . the outside is precious , but once you open it , the pages are like a black and white newspaper material , and they have no structure what so ever . the pages are boring and do n't look very durable
2075,i rarely write reviews , but i need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is . i have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old , and this cd is in heavy rotation at our house . my husband and i love the music at least as much as they do - - it 's stylish and sets a great mood as we 're making dinner and doing dishes . the kids love it too , needless to say . my four-year-old 's favorites are three blind mice ( she loves when the farmer 's wife squeaks that she 'll give back the tails ) and the final track by peggy lee ( where she says the word *poop* , as in " party poop " - - endless laughter ensues ) . ella fitzgerald 's a-tisket , a-tasket and chew , chew your bubblegum are priceless . all in all , i highly recommend this cd - - everyone will be happy to hear it again and again
2076,i bought this book for my 8 and 10 year old to learn more about american history while we live abroad in europe . i was more than pleased when i began reading the stories and found that they love the book ! from the lewis & clark expedition to pac man , the stories are interesting and succinct enough to hold my kids ' interest .
2077,if you have the big lenses ( 400mm f / 2.8l is usm or even the 70-200mm f / 2.8l is usm ) this is totally worth the addition . the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f / 2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges . check compatability on canon 's website . you wo n't be disappointed
2078,what can be said about this album ? this is one of those albums that re-invigorates your faith / enthusiasm in music ( those who listen to a lot of albums know what i mean ) . some tracks from here were most famously covered by nirvana on their unplugged album , although pained i do n't think cobain quite got the feel that kirkwood gives to these songs . it has a perfect blend of songs that make you want to almost hoe-down and those that you can just reflect on and chill out . particular stand outs on this album are split myself in two , magic toy missing , aurora borealis and the whistling song . this album does take some growing as kirkwood 's voice is abrasive , but this is an album that will truly make you love music . do try it , you wo n't be disappointed .
2079,i agree with other reviewers that it feels good and does n't smell too much , however , i 've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings , and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads . i 'm 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin . on mornings after using this cream , i have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin . there are better products out there
2080,unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging bear spray , do n't waste your time . the stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations ; man goes into the wilderness-man sees bear-man uses udap bear spray on bear-bear retreats . this book is one long advertisement for udap ! ! my book was actually misprinted , missing 50 pages right in the middle . initially i wanted to return my book for a complete one but , after reading the rest of 223 pages , i did n't want to waste any more of my time with this one story
2081,this is the perfect gift for any occasion.i bought one for my husband for his birthday and he took it to work next thing you know everyone was on here buying theirselves one.it is a very easy thing to load pics on and hook up to your tv.he sales cars and hes got his on his desk showing his family off and cars that they also have on the lot for the older people who are unable to withstand the heat so they sit right at his desk and check every car out on his digital frame.i give this frame an a++++++
2082,i am very pleased with the new 2007 hallmark card studio deluxe . i have owned previous versions of this product and for my needs , i am well satisfied . i especially like the ability to use suggested greetings and clip art to enhance my rubber stamped cards and scrapbooking projects . i have used this software to print banners and business flyers as well . it would be nice if multiple images could be contained in a text box . maybe in the future there will be more enhancements to this product for easiser use . i am pleased with the card selection , verses and graphics . for non professionals , i believe you get more than a fair value for the price
2083,i agree with the last reader . i did n't finish this book , it was so boring . nothing happened . and the characters were annoying . i read a lot of books that are n't action-oriented and like them . but this one was awful
2084,as much as it pains me to say it this live cd is not a worthy billy joel release . in fact one wonders why it was released at all . billy 's voice is strained and is prone to over singing and the arrangements are overblown . from the sound of things billy sounds like he was drunk or on medication . a lot of the running time is waisted with lengthy monologues with the audience . why this was put on the cd is anyones guess but it just neans less songs ! however the good news is that this cd has now been blown away by his superb new 12 gardens cd in which billy is the billy of old . the one who sung well and sung the songs straight as they were meant to be sung . 12 gardens is crammed with 32 songs rather than the 26 on offer here and there 's no timewaisting audience chat ! !
2085,downside : 1. i 'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem . the camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems . i switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work . on top of that i now have a memory card with photos on it that i ca n't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that . 2. not good with indoors pictures especially if you try the " night " mode . if you use that mode , even with a tripod , keep your subjects to still-lifes , only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest , they will at best be blurry , at worst they will look like double exposures . 3. indoors pictures set at normal mode , with or without flash , are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera . upside : 1. through its usb cable , it booted right into apple 's iphoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that i took a breeze . 2. outdoors , with plenty of sunlight , gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise . kodak did well with this aspect of the camera 's ability , given the price . 3. we won this camera ( free ) so for me it 's almost all upside...except now i have to shell out $$$ for a good camera ( that will hopefully read my current memory card
2086,the idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful . i have it , have pictures on it , but never show it to anyone . trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous . easier to show a few pictures in my wallet
2087,jon brion does such a great job capturing emotion with great music . hes also so damn great and fitting sound witht the mood of a movie . if you liked this movie , by all means , buy the soundtrack . you will not be dissapointed . eevery time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie , it makes me feel. . just. . good . also , be sure to pick up his solo record , meaningless . if you liked the movie , buy this cd , you wont regret it
2088,i have been a user since version 4. version 4 was bad , 5 was good , 6 was terrible , 7 was great , tried 8 & did n't see the point , 9 was stable and very good . i avoided 10. 11 is very good . in version 12 corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11. so now here we are on x3. let me tell you , it has been 5 years since could say i love this program ! it loads faster than 11 or 12 ( and about a bizillion times faster than adobe 's illustrator ) . it seems in this version , corel has really given it 's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of " i can harldy wait to work on a new project " . many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts . some , like the improved trace work wonderfully and seamlessly . you can go to corel 's website to learn of the other improvments . i think you 'll be pleased . this is a designer 's tool that you can purchase and use with confidence .
2089,this is my first review but i just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program . i bought this game when my children were in kindergarten and second grade . fritz and chester 's program is so engaging . there are rhymes and chants for each piece 's moves as well as for some other " strategy-type " moves . for example , " a knight on the rim is ugly and dim . " what a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play ! this program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies . i would recommend getting fritz and chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play ! my boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade . their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments . fritz and chester 2 is also great and my boys , now in third and sixth grade , still play it
2090,this smarmy kevin costner vehicle is a trite half-baked movie . i found this movie nearly unwatchable . if you 're looking for outstanding movies with a baseball theme try bull durham and eight men out
2091,it seems surprising that canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials . lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver
2092,it has some nice upgrades from version 6. it is quicker than the previous version . highlighting text is a bit easier . it caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports , but i found a patch for the officejet and all is well . it is a product that is helpful in my work
2093,i had two choices watching this movie...smile or laugh out loud . when i was n't smiling i was laughing . keaton 's the general is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered . the story line is simple , but what keaton does with it is genius . johnny gray ( buster keaton ) is an engineer for the western and atlantic railroad . he has two loves , his engine , the general , and annabelle lee ( marion mack ) , a fine southern belle . when war starts , johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected . he 's more valuable to the south as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier . trouble is , nobody tells him why he was rejected . worse , annabelle thinks he may be a coward , and tells him she does n't want to see him again until he is in uniform . just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the general and take it north , destroying bridges and lines along the way , while a northern army moves south . unknowingly , annabelle lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped . johnny sees the general chugging away and races after it , determined to bring back the general . when he realizes annabelle lee is held captive , his resolve knows to bounds . for the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest , fastest , funniest chase movies ever filmed . keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny , but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point . and when he rescues annabelle and realizes how hopeless her southern belle helplessness can be , his exasperation is matched only by his love . the general features a big cast , a major battle , fleeing armies , a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge . keaton 's timing and inventiveness are legendary ; so is his risk-taking . he does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous . in one , he is lying back on the engine 's cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward . in the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks . keaton has another railroad tie in his hands . at the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as keaton on the cow catcher passes . this scene has no cutting . the two ties fly off as high as keaton 's head . he could have been killed ; instead we laugh . it 's amazing that in his older years keaton could still walk . his body took incredible punishment for the laughs . try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties . his ingenuity is extraordinary . how do you build excitement out of an extended train chase ? both engines are behemoths and are on the same track . they ca n't pass each other . keaton does it with endless bits of business . in fact , he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split-second timing . what makes keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he does n't do double-takes . he barely reacts . but he 's no stone-face . keaton 's characters are simply very serious fellows . things happen to them . his characters do n't react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions . this edition of the general comes from kino video and looks good . it includes two keaton short films , the playhouse ( 1921 ) and cops ( 1922 ) . in the playhouse , keaton portrays all the members of the cast , orchestra and audience in a stage show , including nine members of a minstrel act , the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp . in cops , he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another
2094,works fine . like several other office packages lacks database program , access
2095,i love jazzy hip-hop of the early ' 90s and if you do too , this is the album you must listen to ! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous ( and the most beautiful of the entire cd ! ) " award tour " , " steve birko ( stir it up ) " and " midnight " . enjoy this pearl of real hip-hop ! ! !
2096,i do n't know how this works because when i found that i would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work , i returned it . it is n't evident in the advert for this ( or any other ) heart-rate monitor . i guess i 'll have to trust my sense of pain.. .
2097,i purchased the waterpik na-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment , expecting it to work with the waterpik professional ultra dental water jet , since that is what was advertised . they do n't fit in this model , so do n't waste your time purchasing both together ! the sinus attachments are too short , so they ca n't " click " into the water pik . the end result : water leaks out , and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment . i had to return both items since the amazon rep could n't find any sinus attachment to work in the waterpik ultra model . it 's a shame because i love the small footprint of the waterpik ultra , and it comes with a lot of cool attachments . hopefully waterpik will come up with something in the near future
2098,i purchased this size ramp to handle wheelchair access over the two-inch threshold to our house and it has done that , but i wish now that i had selected a size longer than 16 inches in order to have a more gradual incline . i use a power wheelchair with plenty of power but have found that the chair 's direction becomes a little unstable when it reaches the top of the ramp due to the slope , necessitating careful maneuvering to continue in a straight line into the house . it was easy to install , however , with the included mounting screws and seems sturdy and durable
2099,my daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school . it was n't until years later that i saw it , and i was horrified ! ! ! this was a movie aimed at children ? ? ? what does a children 's movie need a sexy bunny for ? the lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and " strutting her stuff " on the basketball court in a very provocative manner , until the male characters were panting , drooling , and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick , depraved perverts . this scene was highly innapropriate for children , and is not the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls . not only that , the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities . this movie should be kept far , far away from children , and was truly deserving of zero stars
2100,he was at his best when he sang about the loneliness , perseverance and dreams of ordinary people . in " sandra " for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour . the combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique . in the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions . he released a few inspired tracks now and then , his first christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth , and " here at the mayflower " was a sincere effort . he is an intelligent person who cares for music and does n't let his superstardom go to his head . so , what has changed ? and why this late in his career ? barry has reinvented himself as a las vegas entertainer , liberace style . and he 's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens . i have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy , like liberace did . and i have deep respect for that . but i personally regret that clive davis and manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that does n't really have any demands .
2101,this replacement battery is half the cost of canon 's yet offers longer life . i bought it when i first got my sd10. when one battery runs out , the spare goes in . the lenmar still works great while the canon is near end life ! i am buying two more since they are so cheap ! do not buy no name batteries on ebay . they do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money ! do n't do it. .
2102,i love pablo 's act on comedy central . this one does n't even touch it
2103,i love the olay regenerist line ! moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth . you will see a big difference after the first use ! i 've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it 's great .
2104,i bought this a year ago and have taken many great pictures with it . it 's light , has many features and can be used as an automatic when all you want to do is point and click . i ca n't recommend it enough .
2105,i am a biochemist by education and was a teaching in physiology in a university . as such , i am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general . i really like neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality . for most people , i think it offers great protection , but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer . according to my dermatologist , recent studies have shown that spf 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and does n't offer adequate protection after that time . this is partly due to most people not using enough . in other words , they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection . for this reason , neutrogena spf 45 or 55 is better . also , the neutrogena ultra sheer products have been updated to include a technology called helioplex . most dermatologists that i know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important . i have used both this product and the higher spf helioplex formulations . in practice , i have found both adequate for my needs . what i particularly like is that you do n't even know you have the product on . it has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you ca n't even notice it . both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use , but my understanding is that the helioplex formulation is even better . further , it feels exactly the same on the skin . the only drawback is it 's a bit more expensive . this is also a good product because it protects against both uva and uvb rays . both are implicated in skin cancer and it 's important to protect yourself against both . if you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one . however , if you want the very best protection try the neutrogena helioplex spf 55. this will give you the most peace of mind
2106,i owned the original vhs version...i quickly gave it to a friend of mine , free of charge . eric johnson may be considered a guitar great ( i do n't get it ) , but he has the personailty of a shoelace and it is aptly demonstrated in this instructional video . some people just are n't good teachers , no matter how great a guitarist they are . as an added bonus , his guitar is drenched in reverb throught the entire video , even during specific examples & demos ! say what ? finally , the length of the video was way too long ( or at least it felt that way . it took repeated viewings for me to get therough from start to finish ) . throw in a mind-numbing finale / lecture about patch cables , cable length , pick gauge , strings , theories on physics and you get eric johnson : total electric guitar - agonizing to watch & absolutely god-awful . stick w / brian setzer ( the rockabilly instructional bible ) , james burton ( hello.....elvis ' guitarist ! ) , yngwie j . ( the only instructional video you need for precision shredding ) , danny gatton ( 1 & 2 : encyclopidias of all styles ) or b.b. king : bluesmaster ( extremely in-depth analysis / demos of b.b. 's style by b.b. ) instructional videos / dvds . even if it 's not your style , these are highly informative , educational & entertaining . i highly recommend these
2107,there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted . this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought . i did not do much research . i think the data may be in there , but i could not learn how to make it work . the interface is horrific - unusable . do n't do it
2108,this is an imaginative take on the jack and the beanstalk story . while it was apparently made for kids , the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested ( i 'm 19 ) . plus as a female , i appreciate the fact that it 's one of the few stories where ( possible spoiler ) the damsel ( who 's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women ) rescues prince charming . well-acted , it features some great chemistry between sara and modine . but i still ca n't give it 5 stars . here 's why ( spoilers ahead ) : 1. i 'm no math person but why could n't the writers be consistent with when jack 's dad died ? one minute , they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when jack was 14. since jack is 37 , it shows that the writers ca n't do simple addition . could n't they just take two seconds to do the math ? 2. how the hell does siggy know about goose and harp ? i got the impression from wilhemina that jack 's dad did n't believe the story of the original jack . but apparently , jack 's dad told siggy not to tell him about the family 's dark secret until he was ready . i wish there was a more believable explanation for siggy knowing a lot more than he should . 3. if siggy is smart enough to know the all the robinson secrets , i think he should be able to catch on to the fact that jack is in love with ondine fairly quickly . i always wondered why he did n't try to kill ondine when he was so against jack having an heir . i understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones . do n't get me wrong , i do n't want ondine to die . i wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and jack . but shooting her ( or at least threatening her ) would have been a great way to kick up the tension / suspense . 4. siggy 's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that completely fell flat . it was not funny and was a bit gratuitous . but if you 're a fan of romance , adventure , or just feel-good movies in general , those things should n't keep you from enjoying this film . do n't think too much about the plot holes - you 'll go insane if you do
2109,this is a nice bag , but do n't buy it for a canon s2 is it will not fit . the product compatibility lists the s1 is since the s2 and s1 are very similar i purchased this bag . i ca n't even get the thing in the bag . it is a nice bag however and have put my smaller kodak camera in it . there is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it 's accessories . good quality
2110,product is exactly what you would expect . i have been using it for 2 months 3-5 times a day with great success . i would buy it again knowing how well it works
2111,this is an essential collection for every al pacino fan . in carlitos way and scarface he does one of his best work ever . then there is the performance that gave him his only oscar so far in a scent of a woman . if you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the al pacino collection
2112,the form of chinese meditation called qigong is based upon the fundamental lessons of internal elixir qigong - and the first step in learning this process is to absorb embryonic breathing theory and techniques which were long kept secret within buddhist monasteries . dr. yang translates and discusses most of the documents available on this arcane process , providing a summary of the practice and an important analysis of the breathing technique which is essential to the study of this ancient buddhist discipline . an essential key to understanding
2113,i feel home designer suite 6 is a good value for the price . it obviously is not a full blown pro program , which i think many people expect , however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling . those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning . it is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual , or on the provided cd
2114,this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [...] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?
2115,i have found another product that i want to recommend . it 's called alert and is sold by consultants like avon , but you can also go the starlight website and order it . it 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters , and as a bonus i do n't feel hungry when i 'm using it . they also have a product specifically for weight loss . i have tried that as well . i did feel a bit jittery at first.. . but it settled after a week or so of taking it . i would recommend it also . i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs . i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss , but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings . i 'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need ... energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it . i 've used this for years and have not had any problems .
2116,the lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility . the stabilization aspect is a great help , although it does n't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions . highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the canon rebel xt
2117,an incredible task carried aout by two prominent researchers in the field . arato and cohen accomplished a great job in this work . the reader both will find a lucid theoretical evaluation of the concept of ' civil society ' and will have a better understanding of twentieth century political philosophy . also , the book does not only ' summarize ' the basic arguments and debates about ' civil society ' ; but also offers a new understanding of our social and political world by their genuine model . as a researcher in the field i do really appreciate their effort and thank these two brilliant researchers for their fastidious and meticulous work .
2118,i purchased this humidifier , and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week . one night , it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again . i called the company , who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out , and they would be sending a new one to replace it ( with no cost for shipping to me ) . i received the new one a week later , which to my disappointment , did not have the nightlight feature . i also noticed it was from a different brand company . i ca n't remember the name but it also began with the word " sun . " so far , the new humidifier is working fine ( about 2 weeks now ) , but it has a lower water capacity so i have to refill it every night ( vs. every 2 nights with the original one ) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment . the process of replacing , however , was very smooth and also free so i 'll give them 2 stars for that
2119,crudely written . a negative hero deserves better and wharton has written some fine books . sadly , not this one .
2120,there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website . " if there are dust particles floating in the air , they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white , round glare spots . this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly . however , this is not a malfunction . " read : your low-light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem . it is a design flaw . if you are only going to use this camera in full sun , then it is fantastic but seriously , there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !
2121,for those of you who have not yet read this book : this book is about a white-wannabe black girl who pays way too much attention to her friend 's puberty . i have never read a worse book in my life . this book is shallow , boring , and completely pointless
2122,psele una estrella como calificacin slo para poder respaldar a quienes ya han opinado , pues se trata de un bodrio de pelcula . yo , felizmente , slo la arrend ; de lo contrario , la prdida de dinero habra sido mucho mayor .
2123,my one star rating is for amazon 's service , not the waterpik attachment , which i never received . despite the fact that i ordered this on 20 february 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days ( and is still stated to be 7-9 days ) , two weeks later amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 april 2007. i have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days . in my many years ordering from amazon , i have found it 's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay , as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised . i do n't understand why amazon ca n't keep better track of their inventory
2124,replacement blades are a must . the razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases . but , if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day , as i do , then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so . the reminder on the razor is only a suggestion , not a command . after all , it does not know when the blades get dull . so , i simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when i feel it is necessary . one thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin . until then you may have a little irritation . another problem i have solved is the hair on my neck . i use to think the harder i press the razor , the better it would get those stray hairs . but , all i got was a rash . i discovered that if i simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness . replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you
2125,i have not recieved the vitamins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! lost in the mail ? ? ? ? ? ? please let me know what i can do , it has been a month
2126,a commentary on a book of the bible will generally include the commentator 's outline of the structure of that book . a good outline can greatly enhance one 's understanding of a biblical book , so such outlines are important . rarely , though , do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived . this book , which is based on professor lee 's doctoral dissertation , describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text . this method , called " conceptual analysis " , is a modern version of form criticism developed by lee 's advisor , rolf knierim . lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process , where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes . one then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text . finally , the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed . lee demonstrates the method on num . 10:11-36:13 , a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways . he divides this section into 36 units , discussing with each one the rationale for his choices . he then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is num . 13:1-14:45 , the account of the exploration of the promised land by 12 scouts , the largely negative report the scouts present to the people , and israel 's subsequent rejection of god 's plan to bring them into the promised land . the pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section . conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a " scientific " process , with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text . there is no way to completely mechanize such a process , however . some subjectivity is inevitable , and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others . in my opinion , one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text . by this criterion , i believe that lee 's outline of num . 10:11-36:13 earns high marks . his outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text , as he explains in the latter stages of the book . it is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists . this book is a notable exception , and i enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of numbers .
2127,book is totally disorganized . beautiful pictures , but no way of researching values . the price list is in the back organized by lot no & auction no . no reference to the illustration of the marbles in the front of the book , no way to look it up . starts out promising , then becomes a total jumble . totally impossible to locate anything . too time consuming , and then still no resolve
2128,i was purchasing rockin ' wheels ( the one with the train and fire truck ) for my son , and the truck adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together . we borrowed the rockin ' wheels dvd from the library and he liked it so much , i thought it would be good to have two different ones . however , the truck adventures is not as good , and my son does n't even ask to watch it . the songs are lame and so is the narrator . do n't bother
2129,sold as " one size fits all " but they did n't fit 2 out of 3 people in my house . they are tight even on a medium woman 's hand so beware
2130,a favourite writer goes to prison , keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read , then , upon his release , writes the worst book of his career . the concept of the book is good , as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9-11 tragedy . the first 20 pages flow with typical archer style . then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions . my personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to canada or mexico in order to fly to europe during the 9-11 grounding of air traffic . the idea that new yorkers would n't know that montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable . while there is a direct highway to montreal , archer sends the main character to toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes , is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive . once at the border , the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly does n't know that mcgill university is in montreal not toronto as is claimed by our hero . the guard then remarks that he will " meet " a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference . the idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern us / canadian border crossings , with multi-lane checkpoints 24 / 7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality . its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story , but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness . dan cormie
2131,in general i 'm a big fan of movie music , but to tell the truth i expected more from this one . this soundtrack is incomaparable to say lord of the rings or star wars movie music . it lacks depth and emotion and power . unlike emotionally potent melodies present in lotr soundtrack the eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting . i get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called eragon . i get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track . i hope they 'll make better album for the next movie of the inheritence trilogy .
2132,...buy it here and save $s ! shipping cost from the uk added $46.95 to the price and a foreign debit card transaction fee of $2.51 for a waste of $49.46 that could have been spent getting additional models . or get the download version and save even more as like someone else pointed out , the included manual is near useless and has not improved since version 4. practical poser 6 is still the best book to get if you are serious about doing poser 6 development
2133,this is an alright camera . if you 're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace , or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments , this camera should serve you fine . what i liked about it : 1. it 's compact , lightweight and easy enough to use 2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice 3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i 've used what i disliked about it : 1. it 's a bit flimsy to be honest 2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon , evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark . even though it has a night landscape option , it does n't really work . 3. the flash causes a horrible delay ( but that 's been mentioned like 9 , 000 times before ) this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots . i 'd also strongly discourage buying it if you 're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events
2134,nice portable background support kit . stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution . easy and quick to put up . i put it up by myself with very little effort . all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting
2135,this bok was very boring i found it hard to stay awa
2136,jonny 's conversion is fine and i hope he is happy , but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums . if you want christan rock maybe this could be for you , but he missed the mark with me big time
2137," american buffalo " was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic . it is indeed raw , but not at all fantastic . the dialogue is very choppy and i felt out of the loop with it - as if i missed some great detail . perhaps this is a play that needs to be enjoyed when seen performed , rather than just read . i do not recommend
2138,with a per-user price of $8.33 ( when priced at $24.99 for 3 users ) , this is a wonderful deal and was just what my 6-computer office needed . it was easy to install and appears to work well . my staff loves the anti-spam feature .
2139,version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than version 5
2140,too much wrong information in the text . photo captions = hit or miss . altogether : unreliable . take your needs elsewhere
2141,filmed at new york 's improv in 1971 , we see a young pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous . more polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album & quot ; craps after hours . &quot ; however , witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother 's prostitution , then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said . this scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come
2142,do not buy the case canon sells for this camera . it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in
2143,the concert in central park is not only the best of simon & garfunkel 's concerts , it is one of the best of anyone 's concerts , in my estimation . the crowd was really in to it , and simon and garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music , and the era it was written in . i have owned the vcr tape for years , and enjoyed it many times , but the signal was beginning to fade , so i was very pleased to see it released on dv
2144,if you are looking for a great all around camera , this is it ! our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all . also love the " last 4 " feature , gets some great action shots . we had the fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me . love the new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) as well as the battery drain . i used to have to replace batteries every day , now its more like once a week with the amount we use it . my other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where i forget to put it back in the camera after downloading ! so there is always one in there ! . the video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots . in general , without spending a lot more , you get a great camera that keeps up with an active " picture happy " family
2145,i live in colorado , one of the states that receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation has gotten so out of hand . this movie is about a town called farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they ( literally ) wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of their neighborhoods . some live 20 to a house and have cars coming and going every day - ( imagine how that would bring down the resale value on a home ? ) the aliens surround the streets to hustle for work right out in the open . the video documents the two sides ( the ones who support , and oppose ) the situation . the side that opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their exasperation at their own city 's inability to instill order and law . as women who go to the neighborhood 7 / 11 are whistled at , they become nervous ( as a women offered in the video-unfortunetly it was not shown ) . the thick misogyny in the mexican aliens was especially disturbing ( example : a women who was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her , as in the mexican culture ) . some create groups in support , others create and claw for order . eventually a town meeting is called in which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal aliens who nod in agreement . it is especially poignant to watch as this everday american women brings the situation to her counsil members . they call her a rascist , and many of the illegal aliens surround this politician in support.it was disturbing to see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians than one law-abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill order in her own town . i do n't believe it portrayed the opposing townspeoples side very fairly . they had every right to be exasperated-our we not in a terror war ? since when does mexicos problems come before our own ? maybe because it was made by carlos sandaval it was more unobjective . i felt the film more unfairly depicted the opposing ( against illegal immigrants ) as ' mean ' rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws were n't being enforced ! when does the nations people not have a voice in their own country ?
2146,most other reviewers listed here believe that this cd is good - i wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier mannheim cd 's have made it difficult to critique a mannheim offering ! i am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular cd sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music , just with different chords . in fact , if i was not paying specific attention , i could n't tell when one song ended and another started ! i enjoyed what i heard , but i was certainly expecting more from this cd - many of these disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least , some variety seems to have been called for . disney has always included great music with their movies , running the gamut of musical styles such as classical , jazz , blues , and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high . i do , however , highly recommend mannheim cd 's in general - just not this one
2147,this scope is one of the best gen 1 units on the market . at 36 lines / mm , it has just about the best resolution . most other units only have 24 lines / mm . the illuminator is bright ( almost too bright ) , uniform , and has a crisp edge . it could be a bit larger , however , so that it would fill the field of view . note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens , ( to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification ) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof . do n't bother with the ir flashlight . it 's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform .
2148,i found this book to be helpful as an overall general guide . it covers much of the general information needed to start and keep a saltwater tank . i was hoping to get more detailed information about different tank environments ( reef , fish-only , invertebrates ) , saltwater species , diseases , etc. i would suggest for the true beginner
2149,this dvd is awesome the only problem i have with it is its too short only 4 episodes .
2150,this disc is pure gold ! featuring a full live performance from their 2004 european tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate stray cats fan collectible ! the concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80's . they show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show . they go through all their classics and then some . whether it 's " stray cat strut " " gene and eddie " or " rumble in brighton " what you see and hear on this disc is flawless . must buy for all music fans , not just fans of the cats
2151,i have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money . every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll , now i have to pay if i want their help . it is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money , no longer has anything to do with their customers . and this customer will not be one next year
2152,i like the idea that michael lewis wrote this book / article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that . having said that i did not like this book : 1 ) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times . i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis ' point . 2 ) the story lacked the depth of lewis ' other wonderful books - where 's the who / why / what that lewis used to moneyball ( and others ) educational - i wanted the story behind the story . 3 ) who were all the pictures of ? i found them distracting.. . i 'll continue to read lewis ' books bu thope the next one is bette
2153,well , almost . the seats were good and i drank straight out of the bottle . the dvd was n't what i thought i had purchased but i 'm not at all unhappy about getting it . very , very , very good quality audio / video and i do n't mind watching it often
2154,this entire cd & hbo special is stolen material . all this material was originally written & performed by bill hicks . buy hicks dvd " bill hicks live - satirist , social critic , stand-up comedian " if you want the material in its true form http : / / www.amazon.com / exec / obidos / tg / detail / - / b0004z33fk / qid=1130712550 / sr=1-1 / ref=sr_1_1 / 104-5459925-2315938 ? v=glance&s=dvd bill hicks was also paid tribute on tool 's aenima album
2155,i bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for christmas . it was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using . he has been enjoying the features offered by this device . he especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use . it gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves . he has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints . it was a great price for a quality product
2156,someone get this band a producer and put them in a decent studio , please . the recording and mixing on this disc is flat-out atrocious . download a few tracks and hear for yourself . ' feburary ' and ' 99 with an anchor ' show promise . otherwise it 's taking back sunday meets hawthorn heights meets fallout boy meets .... you get the picture
2157,a pathbreaking work in women 's history and the history of deviancy , this book argues ( if not entirely convincingly ) for a new interpretation of the history and relationship of girl delinquents and women reformers . odem traces the history of middle class women reformers towards sexual delinquency by young girls through the particularly rich case history of los angeles county . noting the diverse cultures in l.a. ( white , working class , hispanic , african-american ) odem argues that many girls who became labeled & quot ; wayward&quot ; were acting out against oppressive and repressive families who held old-fashioned and patriarchal views of girls ' sexuality . odem also explores the eventually oppressive route that reformers took in & quot ; retraining&quot ; wayward girls
2158,suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic , to refer to rabbi david berger 's book , the rebbe , the messiah & amp ; the scandal of orthodox indifference
2159,buddy holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th century masters series . every one of the cds in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous . this one is no exception . look elsewhere
2160,there are n't many films from any era that come close to being " perfect " ( though that 's not really the right word ) in just about every way- -probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over . " friendly persuasion " is one of those films- -in spades . directed by william wyler and starring gary cooper , dorothy mcguire , and tony perkins , it is a wonderful , human story about a loving family of quakers ( also known as friends ) living in one of the union-confederate " border " states at the time of the civil war in the 1860s . the cast , in small roles and large , is uniformly excellent , none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them . led by beloved , legendary star gary cooper in a great performance as the head of the quaker family jess birdwell , they are marvelous , including child actor richard eyer as feisty " little jess " , scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with " samantha " , his mother eliza birdwell 's pet goose , who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness . there are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements , and a hilarious episode in which eldest son josh ( perkins ) accompanies father jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy , amorous daughters of one of jess 's customers ( marjorie main ) . we are settled into a lovely , lively exploration of the birdwell family 's idyllic existence . then the war intrudes . josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to , even though it is against the teachings of his faith . his younger sister loves a young union officer who is soon to go into battle . rebel troops are nearing the region where they live , and no one , including the audience , quite knows what will happen . there is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young josh gets his first taste of battle , which perkins performs with heartbreaking realism . i recall my father , a world war ii veteran , saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man 's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies . when it is all over and the birdwells return to their quiet , hard-working , loving life as a family , the music ( dimitri tiomkin 's marvelous score ) swells , the wonderful lyrics to the song " friendly persuasion " are sung sweetly by the young pat boone , and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine , completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times . the story has been told with integrity , honesty , humanity , gentle humor , kind restraint and , yes , love- -all of these also attributes of the birdwell family that we have come to know . that is the " genius " of this film . along with a very few others , it shows us who we are , who we can be , and how we can live , all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic . and the film never , ever loses its balance . it 's just a great and good movie . i 've seen it almost a dozen times , and it can still move me to tears . i 'm betting it could be released today , amid the ridiculously over-budgeted , badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma , and that it would clean up at the box office . the term " family values " has been kicked around a lot lately , and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it . watch this truly beautiful film and you 'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words .
2161,i was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before i started using this pillow . when i started sleeping on it a couple of months ago , the pain was gone after the first night , and it has n't come back since then . it supports my neck perfectly . i highly recommend
2162,this was bought as a gift for my dad , who has limited mobility . it 's easy for him to use , easy to handle and gives him a great shave . he really likes it
2163,nowhere on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card ( ms or sd ) . it will not operate without it ! on the back of the package it reads " download photos with usb cable ( incl . ) or simply insert memory card ( ms or sd - not incl . ) " wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they cannot
2164,we caught this movie on pbs when it first came on , and my daughter was hooked . it 's a change from the regular arthur animation - this one is computer animated . she was very intrigued by that fact , and then the story is about a puppy.. . well there you go ! the story is well written , a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after pal . there are even a few catchy tunes as well . highly recommend this to every arthur fan out there
2165,i 'm a fan of dave barry , i enjoy his column , i enjoyed some of his books in the past , and i bought this one with great anticipation . boy was i disappointed ! the story is meaningless , the characters are not interesting , the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny . do yourself a favor , do not read this book ! i ca n't believe anyone recommends it
2166,gene watson was one of the finest voices in country music , and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice . considered by some to be " hard country " , i find gene watson to have a more " pop " oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs ; and in the ' 70 's , that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts . while many of the songs on this album are pure country , others are the typical , drab , 70 's pop that filled the void between the nashville sound and the new traditional era of the 80's . in any case , there is no doubt that gene watson earned his spot in country music , and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today ; including his signature songs " farewell party " and " love in the hot afternoon " . if you prefer the more traditional country sound , his " you could know as much about a stranger " and " should i come home " are also included
2167,as much as i hear time and again that " mindcrime " was the seattle quintet 's finest , i always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career . while i was a big fan of mindcrime and it 's predecessor " the warning " , rage for order is qr 's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish . in a word. . " perfect " . so few bands can boast having made a perfect album . i can think only of the beatles ( sgt. pepper & revolver to name a few ) , pink floyd ( the wall , dark side ) , dream theater ( images & awake ) , and boston ( debut ) . rage is an album to be listened to and appreciated . released in the hey-day of " hair metal " , this album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag . none of the songs , while very image provoking , could be easily made into an mtv hit . although " gonna get close to you " aired on mtv ( rarely i might add ) it did n't even scratch the surface of this album 's potential . overall , the performances of each member outshine anything before , or since . degarmo and wilton trade licks masterfully . rockenfield and jackson keep a very tight bottom end . tate...well...tate was the metal singer at that time and this was his finest performance . while the mix was somewhat lacking , the production was incredible . each song blends into each other perfectly . this was metal that was unique and completely original . i think the term " thinking man 's metal " was coined at the time . that said , i can think of no other release at the time to which that term could be applied . unlike most of their metal contemporaries at the time , rage was athmospheric , intellectual , and surreal . rage succeeded where priest 's " turbo " failed abysmally . it was a stark vision of the future and the metal was more futuristic than we 'd ever heard before . it was like listening to a whole new machine . it still holds it 's own 20 year later , seeming as fresh and " now " as anything in progressive metal .
2168,i eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it 's retractable cord and folding capabilities . even the price was attractive . it really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus . i thought i had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly . now for the bad news : the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time . then , the folding handle , low and behold , broke in half one morning . ( of course , the warranty had long expired ) . this dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and i consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers . when i 've replaced hair dryers in the past , it was been because they 've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out . i 'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone , while very appealing , can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer 's lifespan . i 've now purchased a t3 tourmaline ( a featherweight , quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle ) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan .
2169,i have always used foam rubber as a topper over our mattress but changed to this memory foam . after using it for one month , i have taken it off the bed and it is back in the box it was shipped in . i do not like the memory foam at all . it seems to be great when you first lie down on it and then after a hour or two my body just sinks down until it is against the mattress below it and i am not that heavy a person , 160 lbs . it is so hard to find foam rubber but i will search until i find it and never by memory foam again ! doubt i can get my money back . have not talked to the seller about it
2170,i have listened to the cuts from this cd and was amazed at how quickly it transported me back to the time . there were several tracks that i was delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an entire album re-released . if you are in a mood for a good dose of nostalgia , this is the set for you !
2171,small and compact . let me see everyting i wanted to
2172,pro + great story , teriffic acting , beautiful setting con - some pacing flaws , but not enough to destroy the whole lindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well-cast , perfunctory foil . as as the story unfolds , the differences between british and american style ( and culture ) are revealed , providing a nice subtext to the plot . one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears , from the central story to the character 's lives . good actors all . but my " best actor " award goes to the photographs themselves : the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once . a visually rich film
2173,i am diabetic and i have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein . they satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling .
2174,actually garth hudson , the former organist of the band does not play on this cd ( nor ' every geriatric rockstar's ' ) . the musician you might be referring to is al garth ex of loggins / messina
2175,jodie foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end . the only mystery is in the details . no real suspense . i found the plot to be a little farfetched
2176,i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day . they are comfortable , easy to focus , and a great choice for the price . these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel , concerts , sports , etc
2177,this shaver replaced a norelco advantage ( 6 years old ) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days . i ca n't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because i have n't shaved with a blade in many years . i have used foil shavers in the past ( braun and panasonic ) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it . i have been using this shaver for about 3 months . during that time i have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day . at first i thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old advantage which i thought was doing a great job . it shaves quick and close ( personally i think as close as a blade ) . when you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry . it does n't get any easier than that . i have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too . the only con is i have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings . use electric shave before shaving and i think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation . highly recommended and worth the price .
2178,the documentation is terrible . its going to take a lot of practice . if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine . however i want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x sb600s . just setting the d200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the sb800 / masster & sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail , in the manual . the sb800 is designed for this purpose . so why not include information on how to do this ?
2179,a good choice for newbies that love adventure games . nancy drew 's games are perfect , fresh , relaxing , but also give you a lot of thinking some times
2180,typical feinstein ( " a season on the brink " excepted ) . quick , gossipy , superficial , fawning , etc. , etc. this book is about the 2002 u.s. open golf championship at the bethpage black golf course , a new york state park course on long island . the subtitle , " inside the ropes at bethpage black , " is used here as a figure of speech , meaning " behind the scenes . " ( " inside the ropes " is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself - - spectators are separated from the golfers , caddies , officials , and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action . ) feinstein 's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion . we see u.s golf association ( the organization that conducts the tournament ) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament ( e.g. , 4 , 850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and u.s.g.a. can have a huge payday ) , about random qualifiers and random competitors , and about the resurrection of the black golf course . yet the book does not fulfill its promise . my guess is that feinstein 's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis i had hoped for
2181,what a waste of money . not only was it just average in size but it was made of incredibly flimsy , really cheap plastic .
2182,i too , loved the camera , despite the small lcd screen size , until it got the infamous white screen of death that this particular camera is known for , which usually occurs after the warranty expires ( 1 year ) . photos outside are great , poor low-light photos though , but i paid $100 for it ( and with $20 coupon it was $80 ) . small lcd screen means that it takes less battery power , so the rechargeable aa batteries lasted a long time . white screen of death temporary solution : turn the camera off , and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the " cybershot " logo on the front of the camera . then turn it back on . repeat if necessary . it 'll probably happen again , but it beats buying a brand new camera if you 're on vacation and do n't have time to bargain shop
2183,i used to like rob zombie , up until hellbilly delux . everything after that is garbage . this album is no exception . every song sounds the same and is very predictable . the lyrics are nonsensical , educated horses ? he says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this cd , i think he is running out of material and throwing crappy cd 's together to scrap in some extra money . he needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented . i do n't recommend this cd to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his cd 's / merchandise regardless . 1 star , i went through this cd in less than 10 minutes , very disappointed , and will never put it back into a cd-player again
2184,im not from usa . my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country . i lost 1000 us
2185,this book was amazing ! i 'm giving it to my dad for helping me through college ! great gift for parents and children !
2186,i do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars . his voice is so mediocre that i am suprised he manages to sell many cd 's at all . i would n't waste my hard earned cash on this guy . stick with sinatra and get the best . if not , and you want someone who can sing sinatra style , then i would recommend you listen to the young canadian , michael buble . in my opinion michael buble is a much better singer that tyrell . he can swing and do justice to that genre of music
2187,i was very excited to get my hands on this book . i have been ordering this series from amazon.co as they are released as i can get them several months ahead on their american counter parts . i must say that i was disappointed with the beginning of the book . first - hem is not the character that i wanted to read about . second - the start is slow and the plot drags a little . but - all is forgiven after 100 pages . i warmed up to hem . i actually think that the authors writting style has improved each book and this book just feels right . i was done reading way before i wanted to be done . the ending is nothing but action . i put the book down entertained and wanting more . what else can you ask for in a work of fictio
2188,the bag is suppose to hold two cameras , i have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries . i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here . might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not sl
2189,stoners , music , girls . 80 's high school times in cali . it takes you back to when vans were cool and the girls had way to much hairspray . everytime i watch this movie im ready to hit the beach . good movie
2190,with relations between the west and the islamic world worsening rapidly , a better understanding of islam and its roots is badly needed in the west . one major barrier between understanding islamic culture is the key sacred text , the q'uran , has been little studied in the west , and until recently , good translations were unavailable . many qurans were translated into the same sort of english as the king james bible , and not a glint of the quran 's revevered poetic beauty was reflected in such translations . thankfully , better translations in modern english are being made by leading islamic scholars who have a more sensitive ear to the poetry of the quran , as well as a better understanding of the influence and appeal this text has for believing muslims . like all great works of literature , especially a poetic one like the quran , its power and beauty can only be appreciated in its original language . this is why muslims often say the quran is untranslateable , but when one hears a verse of the quran being sung aloud with a little knowledge of arabic , the beauty ( while unfortunately not fully understandable ) does start to become apparent . but , even in translation , when read carefully the quran still has great beauty from a literary viewpoint . the most beautiful part of the quran in my view is the ' light ' surah , which compares god to a light whose glory fills the entire cosmos . this surah has been a favourite with sufis , islamic theologians like al-ghazzali , and also muslim philosophers as well . while the quran does contain descriptions of violence and its style is often difficult to read for the westerner , it is important to study this work with patience and try and see it as an organic whole rather than a fragmented jumble of poems . it is in this sense the deep underlying unity of the quran and its theology ( which reflects the unity of allah , the divinity in islam ) becomes apparent , especially in the names of god . a good knowledge of this religious classic is becoming indispensible in a world where islam is becoming more important to understand from a global perspective
2191,carl hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources . hoot is set in the seaside town of coconut cove . the plot revolves around mother paula 's pancake house , a fictitious restaurant chain in florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls . the developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records . unwary citizens applaud mother paula 's in coconut cove . the lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed mullet fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers . he pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development . mullet fingers enlists the help of his step sister , beatrice and new kid , roy . beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys . roy is a level-headed kid who moves to coconut cove from montana , earning the dubious title of cowgirl . when you throw in a zany cop , a redneck construction boss , a sly businessman , a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash roy you 've got a pretty good read !
2192,the picture and dimensions are incorrect . it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue . the correct dimensions are 2.9 " x4.2 " x1.8 " ( wxhxd ) . it also fits the fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it for . amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture . i am keeping this one , it is a perfect fit
2193,all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie . this is a very well made movie , with perfectly competent performances . the tone is quite serious , and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up . but then there are many people who loved titanic , which i found utterly depressing . more to the point , though , who cares about the problems of these rich kids ? not me . the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful . and if you enjoy this film , check out less than zero , another gloomy but solid ( & underrated ) ' 80s film . the worst ' 80s film is bright lights , big city - do n't say i did n't warn you !
2194,i purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers . we are all on our feet all day long . after one other coworker told us about the one he had , we all had to have one to help our tired feet . everyone of us is very happy with this product . it is a great value for the price . there are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super . we did have a problem with one , but amazon quickly exchanged it for us . i think it was defective from the factory . great product and even better service from amazon
2195,the only reason to rent this film is so that you can laugh at the stupidity of it . the writing was terrible , the plot so unrealistic , and the " special effects " horrible . this is by far the cheesiest and dumbest film ever made . why haley mills agreed to star in it is beyond me .
2196,i was amazed at how well this device worked and how easy it was to setup out of the box . the best part , naturally , is how well it worked on clearing out my clogged nasal passages . i feel refreshed everytime i used it . it took awhile to get the drainage to stop , but i am glad i purchased this system . it works
2197,i was disappointed getting this product because i 've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron . i actually prefer the cheaper conair 's ceremanic irons w / o the wet on / off feature over this one . it does n't clamp down well on my hair ( i 've got thick frizzy hair ) . the results for me are n't that great , it straightens my hair a little but it 's still frizzy . it 's lightweight which is nice . i do n't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair . i definitely prefer other models over this one .
2198,i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience . i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity . it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems . i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary . it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything . ( that would have been impossible anyway ) i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader ( civil rights ) and unsuccessful leader ( vietnam ) . his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me . if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the work and worship institute website . i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book . this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society .
2199,our firm uses our powershotsd500 camera daily and often takes long videos of our work for our clients and material processing . long battery life is very important . we have over a dozen of the canon batteries . pleased with them all .
2200,this version of the old favorite is an interactive delight , engaging all the senses of reader and listener as they sing and play their way through the story . each page offers endless possibilities to captivate the interest and attention of the youngest " readers . " the progressive repetion of the song makes learning it fun and easy . all the colorful digressions , especially the silly commentaries on each page , can lead to more fun & games . wonderfully illustrated ; sturdy pages
2201,forget the liquids and throw away lens tissues . this cloth works exceptionally well on my camera lenses . i highly recommend it , and am buying a couple more , for my car glove compartment for sunglasses and my computer screen .
2202,has all of the features that i wanted ; digital readout , body fat monitor . relatively easy to set up
2203,took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy . i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag . it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible ( has a divider you can place where ever you want ) so you can secure cameras however you wish
2204,coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small " mom and pop " screenprinting shop i worked at . back then , corel came with oodles of free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not to mention free technical support via a toll-free number . i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs and the dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " did it " for me . industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator . being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features , tools and " look and feel " , illustrator did n't present a huge , overbearing learning curve . in illustrator , i found the same robust features as coreldraw ... which was n't what impressed me about illustrator . adobe 's intuitive programs , and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... that is what won me over to illustrator . illustrator 's ability to edit / create pdf 's in their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop ... with layers intact ? ? ? wow ! ! ! ( i could go on ) now , that being said ... there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator . the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize . the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's " make clipping mask " function . the ability to customize / edit / add shortcut keys is an amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on ) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts a robust set of import and export filters , my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import . this is a must have if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack . if i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out ... i 'd be independently wealthy . why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me . so , to sum it up ... coreldraw is a great program ... but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program . just like in real life , you need a great team . this program , paired with adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly
2205,i purchased this camera 2 weeks ago . i love using it . it has lots of function to play with . it is easy to use . i didnt have trouble taking good pictures in zoom mode outdoor . indoor , i had to use tripod if i use zoom . however , i cant really think of any occasion that i have to use zoom indoor other than my testing last week . besides , it gives great pictures and i loved the price . i kind of considered dslr camera but i gave it up becasue lenses were more expensive than camera itself . i considered one wide angle lense and one zoom lense . it would have cost me almost 2000 dollars so far , i love this camera . if this helps to anyone considering buying this camera , id give two thumbs up .
2206,i 've used the cardiochek 6 times , and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor 's office during the same period . my cholesterol levels according to the doctor 's tests are always around 200. with the cardiochek they vary by as much as 90 points . it is a lot of trouble ( and expensive ) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and triglycerides . no test strips are included in the package when i purchased the cardiochek . the box says " includes check strips " but those are something other than test strips
2207,at christmas 2003 i was very excited with the $50 scale my family purchased for me . it worked as advertised for about six months . then it displayed the err message more and more . we replaced the battery . then it would not permit any function buttons to perform . we just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $7 bathroom scale . when it went completely blank this week , battery of no use , i hopped on the internet to see what anyone else 's experience is . to be fair , i will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right . i hope they can . if not , i will see what the weight watchers scales is like . sigh ...
2208,john sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior westerns filled with tense action scenes such as : " escape from fort bravo , " " bad day at black rock , " " backlash , " " gunfight at the o.k. corral , " " the law and jack wade , " " the last train from gun hill , " " sergeant three , " " the hallelujah trail , " and one of the best of all wyatt earp movies , " hour of the gun . " he succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all western movies , when he had mcqueen and brynner riding a hearse up legendary boot hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui.. . for sturges , the west is a man 's world , and his cool , hard , detached style , emphasizing action , excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier , endorses the point.. . " the magnificent seven " is derived from kurosawa 's superb " the seven samurai , " a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages.. . the villagers in this case are mexicans , plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit calavera , who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans.. . three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them.. . yul brynner is the man , dressed in black , with the luminous dome and the hypnotic mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive chris adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some ' flies from a little mexican village . ' eli wallach is memorable as calvera , chief of the ruthless outlaws.. . he is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants.. . steve mcqueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ( ' we deal in lead , friend ' ) , carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as vin , brynner 's first recruit and second-in-command.. . charles bronson portrays bernardo o'reilly , who explains his curious name to chris , with ' mexican on one side , irish on the other- -and me in the middle ! ' bronson , the strongest face in western , and with a bit of mexican in him- -cunning face , steady eyes , revealing voice- -the character of bernardo o'reilly suits him perfectly.. . this half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team.. . because of his tender paternal instincts , he is adopted by three children who promise him , in case he falls , to bring him , every day , fresh flowers.. . robert vaughn- -who was to do nicely on tv in " the man from uncle " spy spoof- - plays lee , the ' good gun ' with black gloves and nightmares , living in style with no enemies alive.. . brad dexter plays harry luck , brynner 's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold.. . james coburn makes a big impression as britt , the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing.. . his looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks.. . horst bucholz represents youth , eagerness , and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys.. . he was caught on the road by rosenda monteros.. . robert j . wilke is britt 's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many westerns like " high noon , " " the far country , " and " man of the west . " the magnificent seven 's success spawned three sequels : " return of the seven " ( again starring yul brynner ) , " guns of the magnificent seven " and , last and least of all , " the magnificent seven ride . " with a terrific oscar-nominated musical score by elmer bernstein , " the magnificent seven " remains a richly enjoyable western , shot on location in morelos state , mexico.. .
2209,i was very disappointed with this program . but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases . even so , the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating . i learned more icelandic ( along with correct pronounciations ) while in iceland than i did with this program . and besides , anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english
2210,spurlock has brought new meaning to reality shows . constructive , insightful , inspirational , educational , and entertaining , these very interesting journeys had me hooked for 6 hours straight . just think what you could do with your own life in 30 days ! should be emmy nominated ; it 's that good . brilliant
2211,i was extremely disappointed with this camera . it 's a shame there is no option for zero stars , because it does n't even deserve one . i bought two of them for a vacation to belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water , and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera . now i really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can . all of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible , terrible quality . the camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water . those pictures were so grainy that we could n't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of . extremely disappointing for a camera that was n't even submerged in water . not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none , so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they were n't even on the negatives . i was so disappointed in this camera that i wrote to kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras . unfortunately our trip to belize was a once in a lifetime trip , so i have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done . and i have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again . if you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories , do not waste your money on this one . the only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment . i wish i had done more research before purchasing this one - please do n't even bother with it
2212,about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music . the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who 's not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick , incestuous , and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in . if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood , do n't watch this
2213,in installed this product on a dell optiplex gx110 ( admittedly not the latest , but still a very standard machine ) running windows 2000 with 512mb of memory . in spite of spending literally hours with the software i was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse , as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video . without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls . multiple emails to broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that i refer to their website for help . this site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems ( like not being able to read the install cd ) . it would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver . be prepared for possible frustrations with this product , with little support from the manufacturer . i cannot report on other features of the software because i was never able to produce even the walls of a structure
2214,i searched and researched the lens to purchase with my canon rebel xti for weeks because i knew that i did not want the kit lens . i also did not have the money to spend on a 5 , 6 , or $700 dollar lens . in the end after reading countless reviews , ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion , this lens looked to be the best value . for the money i really do n't think that you can beat this lens . it focuses quickly , it is really quiet while doing it , and it is sharp enough for the money . plus it has full time manual focus , which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range . the only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the 1.6 crop factor on the rebel xti , but i would much rather have to deal with that than a sub-par image . in summary i would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who does n't have the money to buy an " l " series lens . it is really a great value
2215,we have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science , math , and technological education for everyone . the first one occurred after the sputnik fiasco , when the russians beat us in the race to reach space . the concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the american association for the advancement of science , and educators saw in comparison of assessments made of students in the u.s. and those in other developed countries , such as japan . the answer to this concern was for the aaas along with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific literacy , and what the public in the u.s. should at least know to be scientifically literate . as usual , though the aaas addressed the fact that certain groups in the u.s. were not being ' included ' in the pursuit of science literacy , such as women and racial minorities , in this their first book they skipped over those of us with disabilities . since this is a major concern of mine and the area in which i do research , i was appalled to see they neglected ' us ' once again , especially as the aaas has a separate department dealing with the disabled / deaf . in spite of this mistake , the writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that our country can be more scientifically literate . with new information being made available through newspapers and the internet on a daily basis , it is absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race , gender , or ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care , decisions on employment ( since health care is one of the top employers in the u.s. today ) , and to teach their children . this book was the beginning , but it is n't the end . more books have further elucidated what is required for science literacy from both the aaas and other science groups . this is the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their students to become scientifically literate . karen sadler , science education , university of pittsburgh , klsst23@pitt.ed
2216,i bought this as a present for my wife . i was looking for something that she could carry in her purse . the automatic functions are easy and functional . it is not an enthusiasts camera : too hard to get into the menus . the screen is easy to turn off ( this sucks battery power ) . and it even has an optical viewfinder ( a rare finding lately ) the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes . the pictures are clear and the colors are excellent . the drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg . the wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary ( read that as expensive if you lose it
2217,my desktop cd-rom refused to recognize that the cd was in the tray . it did recognize other cds . my desktop is a hp pavilion 2000 with windows xp homeversion . my laptop did accept the cd so i know that it is not the cd . i purchased the product for use on my desktop , not the laptop . i would appreciate instructions on fixing the problem
2218,i get the sense that the fleetwoods'body of recorded work is n't given the respect it deserves . over the course of their career , the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection , as good as it is , is pretty much all that 's out there on cd , save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground . rock and roll has always had a soft side and it 's in this area that the fleetwoods really shine . their cover of thomas wayne 's & quot ; tragedy&quot ; is an evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-i ca n't put it any other way . maybe that 's the reason why the fleetwoods are given short shrift today : they 're the perfect embodiment of a ( then ) nascent teen culture 's soft and gentle side.this collection features all of their hits , some well chosen album tracks and the original pre-overdub version of & quot ; come softly to me&quot ; . if you like this recording , try looking for their original lps . ( my personal favourite is the 1963 & quot ; goodnight my love&quot ; album .
2219,i found this product to be very unique , and helpful , in that i could quickly remove & retain the glasses around my neck . being far-sighted , i have come to need reading glasses , and these are perfect for my needs . i can look ' down ' through them , and look ' over the frame ' for distance , all while they are secured around my head and neck . i do hiking , using a gps device , and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand , while also looking forward towards my path of travel . thank you for the innovative product
2220,i found this to be a absurd movie . it just has alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched , and the plot itself was n't a strong one at that . to me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie , and it just did n't work . it tried to be a movie that all the family could watch , and it did n't work . it tried to be a disaster movie , and it did n't work . it tried to be a drama , and again it did n't work . i got a few chuckles out of it , it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that i watched it , but it was just sloppy , and uneven , and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning .
2221,bobby bare is a great singer , one of the most underrated country singers ever . however , most of the songs on this cd pale in comparison to his earlier work like & quot ; detroit city&quot ; and & quot ; millers cave&quot ;
2222,i bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great ! my screen broke on my nokia 6102 , and i ended up buying a razor . i had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me . transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes . also , the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone .
2223,we bought this at suggestion of our dentist . however , it is difficult to use , extremely messy and the on / off button on handle is difficult to press . we used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience . our neighbors bought the same model , tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave . save your money and go back to flossing !
2224,this movie was only good because of two reasons . rammstein , and queens of the stone age . other than that , completel out of control p.o.s. that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell
2225,now that i have had this on my camera for a while now , my camera feels so weird with it off , i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to . i wish the buttons were the same plastic / chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain
2226,this book covers in depth the lbo of rjr nabisco in the late 1980s . recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew i wanted to go into m&a work , i decided to read it . i thought the book was excellent , but maybe unnecessarily long . the authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation . the two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not , but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless . for someone interested in pursuing a top wall street job , this book is a must . for everyone else that just likes good non-fiction , this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era
2227,jennifer jason...can someone puhleeze tell me why she always plays the same role ! and why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution ! the so called ~bostonish...or upper crust- -east coast accent does not include..slurring your words as if a consonant was too much work . it as if her upper lip is never engaged at all..not even to smirk ! does she have a botox complex..use your face..including your upper lip.. . but then again...maybe she was acting just like dorothy parker..who ahem..happens to be dead. . ! ( no disrespect intended. . ) jennifer beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance..why did n't she play parker..i believed her character ! gwyneth..love her. . ! bit part..but she added a much needed warmth to the film. . i cared for one character..and the best part was his bit giving a financial report..i thought that was brilliant. . ! bravo..but mr. benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character..thank you. . will someone please make this film over..and do it right. . ! and do n't just call up your buds..for a tupperware party and say..hey..lets make a movie. . ! dorothy parker deserves much much better..i ca n't even imagine the biting remarks she would print..how about. . ' it 's all about me..and i hated it. . ! but the costumes were nice. .
2228,they sent me a product that was n't legit and would n't take it back . horrible service & i do n't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor ! just a horrible waste of time & money
2229,( david 1930 's mobster ) ...... this movie is based on the year 1935 , the dutchman 's last year of life . it does n't paint the real picture of the dutchman or his orginazation . ( dutch schultz was a ruthless hot head who did n't entertain a thing . billy bathgate was supposed to be dutch 's protege but was merly an errand boy ( no gun play at all ) . there was almost no gun fights in this movie or the showing of daily operations which was still going on in 1935. there was a apperance by lucky luciano which was good but nothing shown of the commission which dutch was a part of . the best dutch schultz i have seen on film is ( hoodlum ) . if your like me and want the real 1930 's & 40 's minus the watered down or mis leading facts , d your homework before you buy or rent . or read the review and look for david 1930 's mobster )
2230,beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size . it was n't even close . no size was given for the lense diameter . i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping & all the hassel of packaging it
2231,this is my first electric shaver and i am very pleased with the results . use the trimmer to reduce the length of the hair and then use the cleancut to " make it smooth " . no knicks no cuts ! ! ! i am pleased !
2232,hey...this is a great dvd with great packaging- -definitely one of the best that i 've seen , and there is a lot of extras . definitely a must-have for he-man and she-ra fans ! i just got an e-mail stating that the distributor of he-man will be releasing she-ra on dvd , starting july 11. that release will be " the secret of the sword " and five other episodes deemed most popular by fans . after that , in the fall they will release the complete 93 episodes in three separate volumes within the next 12 months . for anyone who wants to see for themselves , go to tvshowsondvd.com and look at the news for she-ra . i hope you are as excited as i am
2233,there are already tons of reviews on the eos 300d ( digital rebel ) but i do want to share my experience with the camera , so i will keep this short . i bought this camera about 5 months ago and i am in love with . i was not new to photography or to slr 's , but new to the world of digital slr . i had previously used an ancient minolta x-570 , a " pro-sumer " 35mm film slr with a vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens . first and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures , very high quality and no distortion that i have seen . this camera is particularly good as a beginner 's dslr because there are so many options to use and learn . but until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues , you can use this just like a point and shoot . battery life has been excellent so far : thought i would suggest getting an extra to have as a backup for long days of taking photos . i have also been quite happy with the kit lens , which i was n't sure i would like since it is not as versatile as the lens i had been using on my minolta . but the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool : i have been able to take some great shots , while also learning what kinds of other , better lenses i would like to add to my setup . **the only issue i have had was a problem with a sandisk 2gb cf card . after about 300 shots , the camera froze and stopped responding to that card . i was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact , but do n't risk it . if you 're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera , spend a little extra money on the sandisk ultra ii line of high-speed cards .
2234,mississippi and sugar baby are great songs , up there with the best dylan has done . however , the rest of the album , while listenable , is n't all that memorable . still , i suppose it 's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still , after over 40 years performing and recording . the same cannot be said for ' 60s peers like paul mccartney or the stones . overall , time out of mind was better , although that too was a little overrated , with only not dark yet , standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs .
2235,this ' game ' is awesome , if you like sims.. . do not buy this if your goal is to enjoy a leisurely drive once in a while . ' playing ' it is hard work and requires your full concentration . great tutorials to teach you how to drive on a track ( it is *very* different from taking the family car for a spin ) . i got it with my logitech g25 ( an awesome ffb wheel ) . i think these two were made for each other .
2236,i owned this as an lp and played it over and over on my tiny , mono phonograph . i loved it then and i love it now . rainmaker , i 'm on my way back home and love is all that i ever needed would all have been sucessful singles . i would have loved you anyway is the only song i do n't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny . all the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that 's ok ! the background singers get a tad tiring but go david cassidy ! i do n't care if it 's the memories or not , i enjoy putting this on and turning it up
2237,in many ways a relic of its era , " not of this earth " is the first widely distributed release by joe satriani ( a previous ep ended up being reissued as part of " time machine " , years later ) . the guitarist , supported by drummer jeff campitelli and percussionist john cuniberti came into public attention when steve vai , a former student of satriani , ended up singing his teacher 's praises in the music press . the result is that this album , more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music , received wider recognition and poised satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record . the album itself is a bit uneven- - satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist , but as a songwriter , he was n't quite ready . several pieces ( " not of this earth " , " hordes of locusts " ) seem to run out of steam before they end , and a couple ( " the snake " , " driving at night " ) feel like bad ' 80s metal . on the other hand , several pieces shine- - delicate and lovely " rubina " , reggaeish and emotionally soaked " memories " , and the overtly frippesque " new day " are all fine examples of what satriani is capable of . but my favorite is probably " brother john " , where satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone . in the end , the album is ok , but satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future . come back to this one if you 've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more , but most should start with " surfing with the alien "
2238,i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first . i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out . firstly , the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought . it still could have worked for my but for one thing : this bag is not designed for those with a , er.....womanly build . it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me . so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online . just a word of warning to the ladies ; -
2239,this is a saccharine and banal take on irish music , with all the emotional intesity of a hummel figuraine . upon first listen , i remarked to my wife that they sounded more like peter , paul , and mary than the dubliners . she correctly pointed out that peter , paul , and mary were actually much better than this pablum , and that the irish rovers more closely resemble the fictional main street singers from a mighty wind . truly , absolutely , unlistenably passionless , cloying and bland
2240,even if one could afford the full photoshop cs or cs2 , elements has it all for the photo enthusiast . elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation ; quick fix and standard edit . the browser is adequate though i 've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos . many of the features of the full program can be found in elements like layers , plug-ins for effects , and a variety of adjustmens . with a little patience and experimenting , as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you 'll be surprised how creative you can be . this program does not have the learning curve of the full photoshop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer
2241,it is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer . it does its job pretty nicely . the dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world . a little big for travelling , but compromises with its folding handle and light weight . the disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage . it is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment
2242,this cd has all of the cuts that you remember from back in the day...you will love it...it is always in my car
2243,i am starting my career as a professional photographer , and i have n't had any problems with these filters . they come in a nice case , and are easy to attach to my lenses .
2244,his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world , and that the united states is already an empire , but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force . ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life . thus , we get distracted too easily from important events overseas , and when we do try to intervene , we want quick fixes and low costs . i could n't agree more with most of these points . as an american , i 'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance . i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map . also , the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions . countless times , i believe america has done more harm than good by , if you will , talking the talk but not walking the walk . if we commit to something , we need to follow through . this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past . we 've claimed to support democracy in latin america , but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies . we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam 's suffering without changing the end result at all . with all this commonality , however , there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i ca n't bring myself to agree with . basically , he did n't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world . how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone ? wo n't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts ? when ferguson hold 's up the british empire as a model of success , i ca n't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization , with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there . and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism - japan and germany - were already highly developed before world war ii , so it probably was n't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state . even if the positive power of empire is conceded , there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now . it 's a concern of immunity from repercussions . in the golden age of imperialism , europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires . not to say that there were no reprercussions , but , with the only modern navies in the world , europe was immune to any very serious threats . on the other hand , in today 's world , as an effect of globalization , power has become more decentralized in some respects . think wmds , terrorists , and foreign investments in the u.s. economy , for example . can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could ? in the end " colossus " did n't settle any agruments for me , but raised new and interesting questions . it is a book that makes you think , and that in and of itself is worth four stars .
2245,love letters has a very simple concept : two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage . they never look at each other . but within these letters is so much humor , love , and truth that the play will carry you away with delight . i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore . i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i 'd heard so much about it . after page three , i did n't want to put it down . now i 'm buying it for a friend . do n't think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder . if you have ever been in love , you will recognize parts of yourself in this . it always stays true to its well-drawn characters , which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful
2246,it looks cool and it 's easy to carry , but that is about it . camera is slow and pictures are often blurry . sorry i wasted my money on this one . get one of the new ones with vr so you do n't have that issue .
2247,my husband and i are both history and literature buffs , so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to dvd . we are n't typically hard people to please , but this film was one of the most boring movies that i 've seen to date . it 's not that i do n't appreciate artistic , visually stimulating movies - that have a point . perhaps , assuming we all knew the story already , the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass , water , trees...and more trees . apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever ( though i will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there ) , this movie represents revisionist history at its worst . here we are presented with an idyllic , practically un-fallen and un-corrupted view of the noble savage juxtaposed against the muddy , disgusting , conniving white man . perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some native american life like scalping , or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs . it 's fair to say , as the post-colonial talk goes , that native americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years . but by shifting to the other extreme , do n't we fall prey to the same false stereotyping - just going the opposite direction
2248,the ny times book review linked this novel to the aftermath of 9-11 , but that may have more to do with the preoccupation of new yorkers than with the story powers wrote . while he does refer to 9-11 early on , this book concerns environmentalism and species conservation versus wrong-headed economic development in the great plains at the western edge of the midwestern farming belt . it is about the struggle not to loose even more economic ground relative to the rest of america in a region that is being slowly drained of its population due to the changing scale of agricultural operations . but since it is a richard powers novel , it is also about much more : neuro-physiology , brain function as reflected in behavior and personality , the devotion of a 30ish sister to her less-able younger brother , her sexual relations with two very different men , and a nationally-known writer ( clearly modeled on oliver sachs ) who has a late mid-life crisis . it is about love , devotion , and doing as much of the right thing as one can do . it involves escape and return . clearly , powers should not be considered a regional writer . his books have been set entirely or partly in brooklyn , manhattan , philadelphia , l . a . , the pacific northwest , and the continent of europe . but several books by powers are set in the midwest where he is based . readers who know something of the areas in which those stories are set will gain an extra measure of appreciation for the skillful way powers incorporates subtle regional characteristics into these novels . as others have said , this is probably not the best novel this writer has given us , although it is quite carefully plotted , and full of the marvelous insights we have come to expect from him . i prefer the goldbug variations , three farmers on their way to a dance , and , despite my own musical illiteracy , in the time of our singing . but even when powers is not quite at his best , he writes a better book than most novelists ever manage ever to produce . read , enjoy , learn
2249,cheap trick 's second album is very disappointing to me after the good , but raw , " live in the studio " , 1977-76 recorded cheap trick . almost all of the material here is so watered down that it really comes off way better on the later many live disks they did . after a good start w / " hello there " , a concert favorite for many years , is the only thing here to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the budokan and other live recordings later . tom werman and rick niesen were on a show in 1991 that i had recorded on a tape once and werman , noce a friend of tom petersson 's said , quote : " my three albums with cheap trick got better and better.. . " , to which the ever sarcastic rick nielsen said , " selling , maybe . " not realizing that brother rick was slamming him , werman then continued , " exactly " ... oh boy . we now see why producing cheap trick albums through the years has become like playing russian roulette . it 's not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid , but somewhat oeverrated ' heaven tonight ' came out.. . ( and the guys even bought werman back for dream police . things turned out better when pete comita , then later jon brant joined the band . yep - the best was yet to come - in the ' 80 '
2250,within two weeks the hose connection was leaking . the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the
2251,back 2 da basics *1 / 2 stars yo gotti has made some decent albums , but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick , gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map , has some good songs here and there , but the rest are just ridiculous , obnioxus and real pretentious . this is not a good album thumbs down
2252,i really did give this a chance but i ca n't say i like the show . it focuses more on the " police " aspect and less on the science , which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there . i know david caruso has his fans but i just ca n't appreciate him in this vehicle.. .
2253,long studio sessions . if you want a truly incoherent album strung together in a twisted way , then this is it . if you do n't , get near the beginning or rock & roll . get some of their quality stuff . this definitely is n't it
2254,it is wondeful software . simple , easy to use , user-friendly , and very accurate in the pronunciation . buy this cd . do n't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster 's website . also try the medical dictionary . it is as equally superb
2255,i am a prekindergarten teacher . this book is a favorite of all of my students both boys and girls . the story has an important moral that all children can learn from . the moral is to be yourself and that you do not need to copy others . stephanie not only does her own thing but stands up for herself . this story gives children the courage to stand up for themselves and to be an individual
2256,this cd while full of nice music , is to me rather pointless . it 's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals . does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie ? aside from crazy train
2257,the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons . one it is slightly cheaper than others , but most important is that it has the words'do n't panic ' written in bold letters on the cover . the story of the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy revolves around this remarkable book . this story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way . the last earthman , arthur dent , is saved by his best friend ford prefect , who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of betelgeuse . they are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the heart of gold using the infinate improbability drive . inside they meet up with zaphod beeblebrox , the two headed , three armed president of the galaxy , trillian , an earthwoman who arthur failed to pick up and wnt with zaphod , and marvin , a parinoid android . this book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy . these adventures involve mice , an abandonded planet , a rather suprised sperm whale , and the number 42. i loved this book for many reasons . one reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor . another is that it gives a good spin on life . i could always count on this book to cheer me up . do n't just stop with this book there are many others in this series .
2258,i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now
2259,this battery is backwards compatible with the d50 , d70 / 70s , and is used in the d80 and d200. so if you have any nikon dslr and want a second battery , you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery . this battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery , and it is accurate . this is a big deal ; *if you are using the d200 or d80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up . this is the first battery i 've seen that is accurate in this regard . kudos to nikon . ( this feature does not work in the d50 / 70 / 70s but the battery otherwise works fine )
2260,it is simple , handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera . but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks.. . this wired release would be the choice only if you are not a digital rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button .
2261,overall , i was entirely disappointed with this camaera . the packaging and description were deceiving . there was no view finding screen , only a teeny , tiny window as in a regular camera . this was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera . i bought it because i wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen . the construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground . i would not recommend this to anyone
2262,i looked a many other back support pads . some were too big , and others were just complicated . the obus forme side to side is perfect . it is very light weight and small , therefore , very portable . i use it in the car and take it with me to the office . the strap on the back fits well around any chair back , although , i have found i do n't need to use it because it stays put
2263,i am an alice fan , so this is far far from my favorite . the first star i gave was simply because i love kate beckinsale and the movie is n't scary . the other is because it would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that does n't know anything about wonderland . my 9 year old even got bored with this . kate beackinsale plays the mother in the beginning , and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so . she just did n't look well in this movie , and everything looked so cheap and fake . the story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out . i would not recommend this . i would recommend the 1999 american mini series of alice in wonderland , it is my absolute favorite ; with martin short as the mad hatter , and a long list of big names . that one is fun for all ages
2264,unfortunately , millions of americans currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress , anxiety , and depression . in the pharmaceutical industry , anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market . the everyday stressors faced by americans have simply become too much for many to bear , and reasonably so . in recent years , taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin . however , the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently . in the past year , some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light , much to the horror of patients and physicians alike . anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction , severe withdrawal , weight gain , vertigo , and even suicide and death . to treat the symptoms of stress , anxiety , and depression , without negative health implications , many are now turning to natural supplements - - safely and with much success . most consumers are confused about which natural stress , anxiety , and depression supplements to take . fortunately , there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results , safely . the challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one 's that are based more on marketing hype . it is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study , and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product . this is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress , anxiety , and depression . after researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today i can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective . there are a few , however , with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses . these products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress , anxiety , and depression . after review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended , here is a list of the top the top 10 stress , anxiety and depression supplements on the market today : 1 ) anxietol 7 ( tm ) 2 ) welatonin ( tm ) 3 ) pinadol ( tm ) 4 ) seredyn ( tm ) 5 ) prosera ( tm ) 6 ) amoryn ( tm ) 7 ) euphorx ( tm ) 8 ) herbval supra ( tm ) 9 ) clarocet-nri ( tm ) 10 ) relora ( tm )
2265,might be a good video...it just does n't interest our 10 month old yet like baby einstein does
2266,i really wish amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars . this movie is nothing but anti-gun propaganda . i have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this , but it was like watching a train wreck...i just had to stay for the end . you know , for those of you who do n't know...firearms save far more innocent lives than they take every year , and mine was one of them . this movie cd might make a good coaster , but beyond that it is trash . some less than truthful " nra member " ( yeah right ) wrote.. . " i really liked and enjoyed this movie . the acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention . it will keep yours too , just give it a chance . sure , it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry , but they deserve it and need to be more responsible . i may buy the dvd to watch it again , but am overwhelmed with the movies i have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching . however , i may add this to my collection ! " horse hockey . member of the nra ? more like member of the micheal moore fan club . this was the worst movie i have ever seen . they even had to lie to get you in the theater , as nothing was mentioned about it being anti-gun in the trailers ! and saying that it was " a little bit slanted " is like saying micheal moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie ! !
2267,i got this as a present about two years ago , and i have had mixed feelings . i like it , but i get really frustrated because the program is buggy . i cannot create a standalone executable , and the program has random bugs . also , it is very hard to create proffesional-type games . be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card , regardless of whether you use it or not . in conclusion , good idea , but very buggy
2268,there 's nothing in this i 'd say even remotely resembles jazz . it 's repetitive , has a rock beat , and consists mostly of licks taken from other players . if you 're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room , this might be a good choice
2269,i love this seasion but the packaging could be better , i got cut with my copy of it
2270,the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people . i 'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie . usually when a movie runs over 2 hours , it 's because there 's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in . in the case of hard boiled , the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo 's desire to get into the guinness book of records for " most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture . " chow yun-fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay , and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff . he shoots ( usually with a pistol in each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging from a rope , while sliding down a banister ( ! ) , while being hurled through the air by explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . and he shoots , and shoots , and shoots . and the bad guys shoot , and shoot , and shoot . and yun-fat 's fellow cops shoot , and shoot , and - - you get the idea . there are some fine action scenes in this film , but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended . there was n't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next , and it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled . there 's plenty of yun-fat 's balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire
2271,i have been slogging through this book for weeks now , it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium . the book lacks any narrative thrust , often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another . the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to " set the record straight " and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its " barbaric " european contemporaries
2272,i have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my cd changer . i played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more , and it was one of the first cds i bought . a relative first introduced me to this album and of course & quot ; coming up close&quot ; was the reason i bought my own copy . but i came to love each song and appreciate aimee mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter . it is a great & quot ; road trip&quot ; album and & quot ; on sunday&quot ; makes the perfect & quot ; summer song&quot ; . the mix is not mainstream pop / rock . it is not a 1980 's anthem , but it is one of the defining moments , for me . the lyrics have meaning , which sometimes defies what the ' 80 's were about . the only other thing i can say is listen to this cd ! i am sure you will find mann 's unique voice as captivating as i do . it is a definite must have for one 's cd library
2273,there were too many characters , disjointed plot threads , not much of a plot in the first place , and not much coverage of the overall march itself . it focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who were n't that compelling
2274,this product does a surprising job for its low price . it gives my hair so much body and softness , and is extremely easy to use . gets plenty hot enough
2275,i ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price . but it doesnot keep the warm water warm for 10 mintues . the pedicure set is hard to use . the bubbles are not effective.i guess cheap is expensive ! ! !
2276,is this the same kool keith that created dr. octagon , dr. dooom , and black elvis ? & quot ; spankmaster&quot ; represents a regression of creative energy . it sounds like keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks . it contains little of the genius of his earlier cds . with the exception of a couple songs ( & quot ; jewelry shine&quot ; and & quot ; blackula&quot ; ) , this album stinks
2277,we bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all " eurocam " for an upcoming trip to europe . it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip . sadly , the camera is not up to filling this role . we will need to take another camera along with it . however , we will take the v705 for its wide-angle lens , the reason that we picked this model in the first place . it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review . the need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera . if you do not need a 23mm lens , or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens , then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p&s ( point and shoot ) camera . good : fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens ; the 23mm is the default lens ; rapid start-up time ; internal focus and zoom ; chromatic aberration well controlled ; can use 4gb cards ; freeze-frame and extract any video frame . mediocre : soft images ; perceptible shutter lag ; slow shot-to-shot times ; exposure compensation is easy , but steps are too small for digital , and is reset when camera turned off ; flash does not come close to covering the 23mm ; image numbering basically limited to 4 digits ; flimsy construction ; no manual controls ; no raw format ; no optical viewfinder ; histogram on display , but too small to be useful . bad : the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera ; excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression ; poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery ; unacceptable visual noise starting at asa-400 ; forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images , with inability to save the individual panoramic shots ; panoramic component images forced to 5mp ; overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image ( even with display on ` bright ' ) ; mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results . synopsis : if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot , this , and the older v570 , are the only choices . if most of your images are in bright light , the 7mp v705 gives better images . if most images will be in low light , the older , cheaper , 5mp v570 is the better choice . the camera seems very fragile . treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance . if you chose this as your sole camera , you will likely be unhappy with your choice . the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens . = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens . this lens has almost decent optical quality ; though the camera 's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it . on power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens , which is ideal for us . however , considering that this is truly a specialty lens , it would make more sense that the ` normal ' lens should be the default . best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens . better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens . the camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction . this works fairly well , at the cost of even more image softness , but even-so , barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length . this in-camera correction can be turned off . doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance . however , being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is . the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as : manual settings , a physically larger sensor chip , raw image files , or , at least , a choice of degree of jpeg compression . at the other end of the camera 's focal length the 114 / 117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion . there are very few circumstances where one would want to use ` digital zoom ' , so , as with all digicams , the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus . after reaching optical zoom limits , one is much better off doing any further ' zooming ' in an editing program . kodak 's advertised " 5x optical zoom " is , at best , misleading . actually , it is just flat out untrue . the camera has two lenses . the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens , which is not quite 3:1. the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length . ( note , in some places kodak claims 39-114 , in others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading is the claimed " anti-blur technology . " as best i can tell from looking at the images , and at the exif metadata , all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa . certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera . speaking of asa . this is an opportune time to address the camera 's incredibly poor menu system . it is byzantine : being both awkward and time consuming to use . to adduce , ` auto ' asa ranges from 50-200 , to set a faster ( or to lock in at a slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . to change from ` auto ' to the next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control . the menu system is next to unusable in the field . still on asa settings , the camera does have sensitivities up to asa / iso 1000 ( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 , 1000 is available on the camera ) . unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime , will never-happen-again moment , then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying . at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 " . the previous version of this camera , v570 , had only 5mp , but the same sensor size . by increasing the pixel count , but not the physical size of the sensor , the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras , as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality . my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp , as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact . another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which , when calibrated to the sensor in the camera , allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise . doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 " prints at asa 800. if one really wants to get carried away , combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography ( where dozens / hundreds / thousands of images are averaged together ) makes 8x10 's at asa 1000 doable . people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak 's target market . back to earth . the v705 's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras . mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression , which is not adjustable ( e.g. ` best ' , ` good ' , etc ) . my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used . this results in small files , with a lot of compression artifact . the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size , those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb . the more the compression , the worse the image . most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point . kodak picks it for you , and picks poorly . the v705 's video performance is very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , and at very aggressive compression settings . unless it is a video of your baby 's first steps , or aliens landing in the backyard , you will likely find it hard to watch . the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs . compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , and time codes , is 36 mbs ) . better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . that is the choice that most manufactures have made . as a result , the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream , and so are of much better quality . the battery . kodak 's claim is 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , with minimal use of flash and the lcd on ` energy saver' . even 150 would be poor , compared with my other digital p&ss , where i expect at least 200 , and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management . this camera has a proprietary ( and hard to remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries , and , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle , the battery will likely last most of a day . we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera . though the body is of aluminum , the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two . the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use ; there is no cover for the charge socket . the media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used : that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the ( not included in this model ) " easyshare " dock system . this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory , and the overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , the bête noire of digital cameras , is very evident with this model . i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter , and the image being recorded . however , based on over 50 years of tripping shutters , it clearly varies , and i estimate is , at best 1 / 4 second , up to a bit over 1 / 2 second . in addition to the shutter lag , there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens . together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment , an active child at a particular instant , or a wary animal almost impossible . the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation / price p&s cameras from other makers . the accompanying ` manual ' is poorly organized , childishly written . " finish reading this book , so you can take and share your best pictures ! " at best , it was written for 8 year olds . the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the ` full manual ' , however the address given is incorrect . when eventually found , the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level . panoramics , one of the advertising points of the camera , are another disappointment . basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in ` panoramic mode ' , each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image , in order to allow alignment . as with most ` panoramic modes ' focus and exposure is locked on the first image . so far , this is all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , the image overlay is so dark that , even with the lcd set at max brightness , it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements . however , it gets worse . the images must be joined in-camera ! the individual images cannot be stored ! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry . aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2 " lcd in the field gives , in spite of the camera 's best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger , and higher quality , computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home . the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment , and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings . of course , my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera , so we will not be dragging it along . you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production . much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved . reading back through this review , i see that it is mostly negative . this makes sense , for , as i disclosed at the beginning , it was my disappointment in this camera 's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place . likely i have said all that needs to be said . so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens . except for this unique lens , the camera 's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market . if you need a true wide-angle p&s , you need this camera . otherwise forget it
2278,having had norton products installed for years including antivirus , internet security , and systemworks , i decided to replace the installed products with norton 360 and a non-norton password manager . obviously , it is critical to first remove all norton programs before installing norton 360. the installation process proceeded relatively smoothly . my computing environment includes a 1.6ghz processor , 1 , 000mb of memory , and 6gb of available disk . the background scans and liveupdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire cpu at 100% cpu utilization . one application that streams radio broadcasts now stops . i immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups , however , the cpu occasionally still locks . additionally , there is no way to transfer security settings from previous norton products to norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive . if you now have separate norton security products and are satisfied with them , save your money and renew the norton subscriptions .
2279,i recently purchased the obus forme lowback backrest , along with the seat cushion . although i have heard people rave about the excellent support , and they felt comfortable enough to me , i ca n't give them more than 2 stars . the material used in their construction drove me to distraction . this is obviously a personal preference type of thing . other folks may have no issues with the material at all . these are just my feelings on the matter : i found the texture of the fabric to be a little rough and it did n't allow easy movement when sitting on / leaning against it , which would drive me crazy after just a few hours at work . also , when making any movements , the compression of the foam , and the friction between it and the fabric covering , made really annoying noises . it reminded me somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it . the backrest was even worse than the seat cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping ( looked sort of like shrink wrap or saran wrap ) around the foam inside , which made loud crinkling noises every time i even twitched . it was awful ! however good the science behind the backrest and cushion is , the sound effects and unpleasant texture were distracting enough , to me at least , to return both items .
2280,the main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away . the quality is very poor . the unit is very bulky to carry around your neck . the sd card slot has some block in it . i was not able to even insert an sd card . all in all , not satisfied at all
2281,i have had to set up a few new installs of the vista business on some servers and i was disappointed with the overall performance . my biggest gripe is when i tried to remotely log in from another pc and i sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click ' yes ' to allow the process to run . how irritating ! kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in does n't it ? . also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the remote connections authorization . so when i *thought* i was remotely logging in under the new admin account name vista would n't let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity - some hidden place it took me 15 minutes to find , i discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when i did the name change . yikes ! for those who need to run vnc server on vista , be aware there are issues - installing and running that you will need to work around as well . it seems like microsft drastically changed the menus , overdid the default security features , and installed a new hood ornament . other than that i do n't see what the big deal is .
2282,i bought three of these - - one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents . two of them stopped working . one of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped . unfortunately , out of the warranty period ! and inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored . i 'm out a lot of money for this garbage . do not waste your money on this garbage ! ! ! !
2283,i bought this book , the paperback version . the text is good , it describes all his letters and tries to do a lot of explanations too . however the prints of his paintings are not that impressive . they are very dark prints . go for some other book if you want to see the corect colors of his paintings
2284,leary is a hack . he was n't " influenced " by bill hicks , he stole material . that makes him a hack . how can you leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack ? take it up with webster 's dictionary . the exact bits leary stole are described in the book american scream on pages 201-202. bill hicks was incensed when he heard leary 's tape . on behalf of bill 's memory , give credit to the original .
2285,i just got back from vacation . i have a bad back , and it was sore . i was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs , i could carry my nikon d-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably . gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses . i have other bags which heft lots of gear , and they 're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot , but if you 're looking to hike ( and have a separate way to carry a tripod ) , then this is a wonderful bag
2286,puts a protective glass over your expensive gla$$ without distortion .
2287,i am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not . my friends and family that i have made cards for think they are the best also . keep making more and more . thank
2288,i just purchased the top end dell dimension xps ( with the 10 , 000 rpm harddrive ) but i still have to allow about 10 seconds for the initial program startup , then it seems to hang for 15 to 20 seconds after that . i usually just go get a cup of coffee when i start act and when i come back we are ready to roll . i also reboot my system every time i close act . the system just seems to run better without any " lingering " remnants of the program in memory . whenever i delete a contact the program locks up . it has done this through several versions . i simply reboot , restart act and it works fine . at some point act changed the date on many ( hundreds ) of my activities to 11 / 18 / 2004. now i manually type the date into the call , to do , meeting and note fields to avoid this problem in the future . i have been an act customer since the early dos days . i have a huge commitment to the program in that much of my important data is now stored here ( and some of it is nowhere else ) . it is so difficult to export " all the data " ( including notes , history , etc ) that i am basically trapped . my point is , a program like this is not one that you can easily bail out of like word or excel , which has some alternatives available which will read your current files . a lot of the act ! database is proprietary and while you can purchase a conversion program from a few vendors , it is not a cheap proposition to do so
2289,first of all , the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles . there are far fewer images than the number touted . this is a scam in my opinion , but a situation i could live with . but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor , actually totally unusable resolution . they have corrupted clarity , poor pixel quality , are distorted , and unsuitable except for perhaps , a third grader 's school project . it was a complete waste of money . it is headed for the first garage sale i hold , and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy .
2290,loving this air purifier ! this was really the first one i have own so i ca n't compare it to any others . it is very quite , and takes alot of dust out of the air . the first time i had to replace the filter i was shocked by how much dust i could of been breathing in . worth picking up , just wish it would of had an energy star label .
2291,i love my nikon coolpix 5900 however , the lens failed in less than one year . service took 6 weeks to repair . the lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair . why is the lens failing to open again ? i absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although i do have a paid plan for it . why ca n't warranty be fast , local and competent
2292,this book provides some brief but good background to set the context then proceeds to succinctly communicate those aspects of uml one really needs to know
2293,i believe this will be very helpful for christian people to understand who god is through the life
2294,but a good debut album . this is when i felt proud knowin ja was from ny . no radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part . but i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you ca n't keep talkin about it , which is why i guess he changed his style . now the subject i wanna hit . has anyone noticed that guy named progressive ? why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture ? and everytime i turn around its some damn rocker / junkie hippie . last time i checked rhythm and melody was part of music . i dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock . i 'm tired of our music bein trashed . you know what im a go trash one of they " artist " right now
2295,this is really good software . i own cad software , but it does n't do what punch home design can do . it has a bit of a learning curve , but if you take the " step by step " tutorials , you 'll find it much easier to learn . i did a module of the tutorial ( there are several ) , then i saved that drawing as " test " and loaded my own and did the appropriate things to it . by going back and forth , i got to use the steps being taught several times which made it easier to remember " how " to do that thing . if you 're planning to remodel ( that 's what i 'm doing ) or building from scratch , this software will give you a real good idea of what your completed remodel or construction will be like . it will more than pay for itself by saving you from making a costly mistake
2296,we use our batteries a lot . no problems . works as advertised .
2297,i was prepared to spend the original $26.05 list price for this motion picture soundtrack . at that price it was already the most expensive out of 12 cds ordered . i was refunded the money to " the last starfighter " due to an error listing . when i went to re-order , the new price is $49.95. what a joke ! someone is pocketing an incredibly high profit margin . i would love to have focussed my comments on the actual composition , but until it is sold at a fair price , i will reserve my rating
2298,this cookbook is the best in my collection - and i have a lot ! ! the instructions are clear and the pictures are great
2299,i did n't give this five stars because it 's some kind of oscar-worthy achievement , but if you are a fan of the quirky , b-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties , then this film is a must . " hawk " offers hilarious jump-cut editing , dialogue that is spectacular in its badness , and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film . for all that , the film is also remarkable for its innocence , in a time when cheesecake t&a fantasy like " the sword and the sorceress " and the infamous " deathstalker " series were the norm , " hawk the slayer " keeps it clean , and is all the funnier for it . if you have the right sort of friends , then snap this gem up , invite them over for beer and pizza , and have a go . it 's more than worth it
2300,loaded easily , no glitches . the online account access feature became functional after running the software update . the program is fully functional and i have suffered no inconvenience running this on an intel-based macbook .
2301,this effort shows it 's age . in addition , there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of mengele . i suppose it 's possible for it to be taken as tongue-in-cheek by those at the post-graduate level of study at the cheech and chong school of anthropology . however , i have to admit i was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing
2302,this case is great for the quick day outings . it is rugged and keeps the camera safe . my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky . everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead .
2303,we purchased this dvd because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it 's a great supplement to reading books . he loves this dvd and we love the variety in it 's approach . we did n't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years
2304,it was n't the easiest thing to transfer photos from a computer and to delete the " samples " on the frame was no picnic either , but once learned it becomes easier . i went from frustrated to happy , soon enough
2305,when the lead character acts like she 's sleepwalking through the entire film , that 's distracting ! when just about anyone from my high school 's drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth , then it 's time to open up the wallet , and hire better talent . once you get past the special affects , all which use cheesy models , this godforsaken movie is boring as sin , or , should i say mud ! beside being preposterous , for example , the meteroid , or whatever , only hits a dam in its first strike , this pitiful film is also delusional ! remember the scene where the head of fema risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire . as hurricane katrinia proves , there is no such thing as a bureaucratic , administrator hero ! instead , this movie comes off as a piece of not-so-subtle federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time
2306,there is a reason this book has sold over 180 , 000 copies . it gets right to the point . it accompanies each strategy with a visual aid so you can get a mental picture in your head . further , its section on analyzing stocks and commentary on the state of financial statements and the financial market are right on the money . if your just starting out in options , this book really is a must .
2307,this was a great addition to the " photography basket " i made my grandson for easter
2308,this is j.a. jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations does n't help
2309,i loved the earlier nevada barr mysteries , with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers . i was n't as happy with some of her latest efforts , but still had n't given up on her . now i 'm not so sure . this latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow . the idea that they were from a polygamous mormon sect was a red herring . perhaps it was barr 's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate . the scenes where anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages . each scene was more disturbing the one before it . i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends . but i have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out . i wish i could say that i would read another nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones . but after reading this disturbing , somewhat convoluted story , i would think twice . if i did pick up another anna pigeon novel , i 'd make sure i had something else to read if the story took another dark turn . i would certainly not stick with it to the end .
2310,these did nothing for me . ask your doctor about aphthasol , a prescription drug approved by the fda - - which means it 's passed rigorous government testing standards . aphthasol changed my life
2311,dragon 9 is supposed to have vista compatibility , via an update that you can get from nuance . unfortunately , the update does not work very well , especially in the area of commands . imagine opening outlook and giving dragon the command for composing new mail or even checking mail , and watching it do nothing but move to another message in the inbox . then , imagine going to the nuance site to get support . you have to answer about a half-dozen questions and provide you key , even if you have a registered account that contains that key . finally , you are told that support will cost you $9.95. ten bucks to fix broken software ? ! it 's no wonder they do n't have a support forum ; it would be filled with irate customers . i wo n't even go into the problems with getting the support person to comprehend the problem , except to say that the software did a better job of understanding me . i 've moved on to using the voice recognition in vista which , contrary to a popular youtube video , actually works pretty well . at least when i need help , i can get it for free
2312,i bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography , it had to be easy ! the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends . i have used the older cx-7300 , ( very similar camera ) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions . the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me ; less to break . the c530 is more compact , has better resolution , and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die . if you want simple digital snapshots , you will love this little camera
2313,what to write ? the book is kinda story book , and gives passages after passages . if you are looking for a book that gives exercises to develop your psychic power , this one 's not for you
2314,i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months , but i was happy with the picture quality . i replaced it with the s5100 , it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 ( in particular shutter speed choices ) while on a trip to niagara falls , i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt ( and i mean slight ) after that it would n't power up . i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable .
2315,my son loves music and really likes dan zanes . we started with the videos on disney and the " catch that train " song really got us singing , so we ordered this cd . now my son sings along with it , dances and jumps around . dan zanes really is fun for the family
2316,this animated perversion of star wars is an insult to one of the best sci-fi epics of all times . the characters are utterly rediculus ( seriously , if the jedi were that actually powerful , why did they need the clones ? ) , there is no plotline to speak of , and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting . if you want a good build-up to episode iii , i suggest playing star wars : republic commando and reading labyrinth of evil and the other clone wars novels . do n't wast your money on this , it 's not worth it
2317,well , it was good . i enjoyed it , but it was not the best plot and the characters had 2-d personalitys. . the worst thing , though , was how abruptly it ended . other than that it had that great japanese animation , and it was pretty fun to watch
2318,i received this as a gift . very happy read . captures thoughts you hope your best friend has
2319,these films used to be on tv all the time . i was amazed at how clever the plots were . i did n't remember some of them . " weird woman " is my favorite " b-film " and i 'm always recommending it to people . movies used to be so entertaining ! it 's great to have this collection available to film fans . we can overlook chaney 's stiffness , as the rest of the cast really compensates for it
2320,i thought the movie was alright , but i am sorry that i bought it . i would rather have just rented it . it seems like half of the movie is out of focus , i am sure it is on purpose but i just do n't get it . there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price
2321,despite the chintzy , unconvincing facial hair ( jeff daniels ' being the exception ) ; martin sheen 's too-gentlemanly interpretation of gen . lee 's accent ( and his beard ) ; obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war ; generalized ( and largely inaccurate ) interpretations of the underlying history of the war ; and hopelessly , ridiculously , wildly off-the-mark attempts atnew england accents , the film still works . i understand that to get a film produced and distributed , it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast . but an unknown who looks more like general lee than martin sheen would have been a better choice . and c . thomas howell 's performance- -well , let 's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting . jeff daniels , however , does an excellent job , in large part because he does n't try to convince you he 's from new england and consequently does not come off like cliff from cheers , using every stereotype associated with nasal ' r' -dropping . instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of the ne accent ( think of sheen in the missiles of octobah ) , daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief . but then , here comes ct howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that sheen and kevin costner are n't the only actors who should have appeared as new englanders in an ed wood production . i think the story works because there 's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable . the battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle , but the movie makers either did n't have the budget for gore ( maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards ) or decided to err on the side of forbearance . if gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later , it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction , as in saving private ryan , thin red line , or gladiator . it falls a bit short of that , however . finally , it should be noted that the producers / director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war 's historical underpinnings , opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves . anyone who knows about the boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood . very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery . they fought to preserve the union , which is a very different concept . abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the south 's hand , but it was not the sole cause of the war . the movie dumbs this down a bit , making the message more like what you 'd find in a 5th-grade text book . the battle at gettysburg was certainly pivotal , but viewers should remember that it did not end the civil war . the north absolutely needed to win it , but lee continued to cause the north fits for almost 2 years after gettysburg . c . thomas howell will continue to cause me fits every time i think of this movie . still and all , the film is very watchable . and due credit should be given to the re-enactors , arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film
2322,the fifteen-year-old duncan ( emile hirsch ) and his laconic father edgar mudge ( richard jenkins ) are reeling after the death of the most important person in their life . duncan 's mother and edgar 's wife died suddenly , whilst biking some farm eggs to her neighbor . an alcoholic , she was the glue that tethered this family together , and her death has left duncan and edgar emotionally fragile and at a loss . it is n't only his wife 's passing that is bothering edgar ; he notices that duncan 's a " different " kind of boy - sensitive , kindly and delicate . duncan constantly dotes on his pet chicken and dresses in his mother 's clothes , perhaps in an effort to stay connected to him mom . at church - where he sings out of tune - a neighbor in their tiny farm community comments on how duncan is the spitting image of his mom . duncan is soft , not in an effeminate way ; it 's just that he has an intuitiveness and a compassion that places him at odds with some of the older and rougher boys , who mock him , and call him " weird " and question his sexuality , something he 's already tormented over . was duncan a mama 's boy ? well , we 're not really sure . obviously there was incredible love between them both , but it 's a love that his father is unable to replicate . edgar worries about his son and he loves him dearly , but he 's is clueless about how to help him . he tries to get him to help out around the farm in an effort to toughen him up . he also encourages duncan to go out with his older friends , the ringleader of which is perry ( tom guiry ) , a butch and macho town stud who likes to brag about his sexual conquests . perry 's bravado is a cover-up for his scary feelings toward duncan , and it 's only a matter of time before their relationship reaches a crisis . mudge boy is the perfect example of understatement , a tale of bourgeoning same sex attraction , and also a titular exploration of the isolation of farm life . deeply religious , edgar could be the fire and brimstone type of father ; instead he 's a thoughtful , considerate and caring man , who is at a loss at how to deal with his eccentric son . hirsch , who projects a shy modesty , is perfectly cast as duncan - a boy who is somewhat out of his depth with the people around him , an outcast with many quirks and eccentricities . at times , mudge boy can be difficult to watch , there 's a quasi-rape scene , where the result of some teenage sexual experimentation reaches an ugly climax . but writer-director michael burke is always sensitive to his subject matter , beautifully rendering his protagonists ' dysfunctions and setting them against a bucolic backdrop of vermont farm land with it 's meadows , tumbling down barns and cow patches . whether duncan is sweetly ingratiating himself and getting drunk with the local in crowd , or sucking on the head of his pet chicken , he 's a character who many of us will probably be able to relate to . he 's desperate to fit in , confused about his bourgeoning sexuality and is undoubtedly a troubled and confused soul . the final denouement , when duncan is forced to confront the evils of small town bigotry is absolutely heart wrenching , as is the teary and world-weary reconciliation with his father . mike leonard may 06
2323,i bought this because raquel welch was in it . she did a good job but it 's not worth it . i loss interest as sonn as i heard the guy talking about the people in the movie . this dvd was dated back to the 1920s and how a movie star struggles to get his life back
2324,july 27 , 2005 why have n't i heard about the mia characters before ? i bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game . we opened it together and i was blown away with the 3d animation-the same quality as pixar . everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game . best of all , its educational but because it was so entertaininng , my god-daughter has not stopped playing it . well worth your money ! i 'm going to buy the rest of the mia series
2325,the brilliant theory of general theory of relativity authored by great mind albert eintein , is truely magnificient
2326,lately there has been a lot of talk about how great ronald reagan was as a president . this book shows that this is not even close to being true . under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world . him and his administration sold missles to iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support contras in latin america . under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices . all this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle-class while giving the rich more money . it is debated whether reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book . it is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book . the only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program . recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency
2327,my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon , and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people 's conceptions about going to the moon at that early time . he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things did n't make much sense . well , from a layman 's perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging . it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic , physics and astronomy . even from my scientifically deprived perspective , a lot of things in the book did n't make much sense , such as the actual method of getting to the moon , but this does n't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal . the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous . i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work , and what these poor souls were going to come up with next . compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however , from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative . verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality , and much unlike his other works , does n't stray far from the earthly . some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion , but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read . if you drop at the sight of f ( x ) = y , then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking , centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate . if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today . if you , like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time .
2328,it was an excellent purchase . fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality
2329,purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday . reason ? my computer was moving much slower than it used to . mcafee scans my computer everyday , and does n't find anything , yet it was fully updated . i had a feeling it was n't working . when i installed this thing , i scanned it right away . this is what it found : viruses : 67 spyware : 312 adware : 51 after the scan , everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again . i am very pleased with panda 's software and will purchase again if needed
2330,one i started using the shaver it fell apart . it has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just do n't work . the shaver is a waste of money
2331,windows xp , and basically any other windows based os is junk . after using windows 3.1 , 95 , 98se , 2000 , me , and xp , i was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs . linux however , has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it . spellcheck is one . i have to buy microsoft word or some other office program for spell check , and how much ? ! ? ! i 'll tell you one thing , it ai n't free . linux however , there is spell check , and not just in their word processor . i also found this in their messenger program , email , and even in web browsers , free ! the other thing i hate about windows is " you must activate your copy , and only one copy per computer " . with linux , there is no activating , or " one per computer " . you do n't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate , typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions . you can give someone a copy of linux , and they can try it , for free , and for life ! it 's not 30 days free , or free for only a few people , it 's free for everyone for life ! as for one who mentioned that linux releases more fixes than windows , that is true . the difference between windows and linux when it comes to releases is like this . when microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough , they will release it . linux will release free their os / software right away . you can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs . so in other words , let 's say both os 's have the same software . day 5 comes along , and this software pretty much works , but may have some bugs . linux will release this , and you have the " option " of installing it and trying it out , or wait until more bugs are fixed . windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished . this is why linux has a lot of patches , they give it to you when they first get it going , and as they continue to improve this , you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long . it is also true that windows can be attacked by viruses within hours , where as linux can take several days / weeks / months . also , linux has been proven to give your hardware / computer a longer life span . it can also work better with older hardware so you do n't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time . why not try out linux ? it 's a lot cheaper , and you may be amazed by how great it really is . i prefer mandriva 2006. it 's a great system . final note - windows : very costly , even more so to get the benefits / features linux : free windows : one per computer , or buy more licenses linux : one copy to everyone for life , or each person can have a copy for life windows : boring ; basic programs linux : several programs , multiple browsers , more than one type of software to fit your needs . windows : new hardware / reformat pc : you must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in several numbers to activate your pc . linux : new hardware / reformat : here 's your os installed ; you 're good to go ! windows : constantly gets attacked by viruses linux : quite a lot safer windows : support ? lol . yeah , there may be some linux : various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your os that 's just some of the reasons why i love linux
2332,this comedy , like click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through . the characters in this film can be hated at points , especially michael douglas ' and matt dillon 's but there is a lighter side ! owen wilson is very likeable as dupree , an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job . the cast is fine and one of the strength 's in this film ! however , i think it gets too serious at points . this is supposed to be a comedy after all . i would n't buy it but it is certainly worth renting
2333,this book does what it says . it lists low or no cost campgrounds , they may not be where you want to go or fit your mega motorhome , that 's what commercial parks are for . i do n't know if it is all-inclusive but it certainly has most of the campgrounds that i know of in areas in which i am familiar
2334,man , have i given this guy a chance . multiple chances . listened to the cds , saw the big hbo special . i mean , his career is red hot now . he clearly has lots of fans . mostly college age ( perhaps this should be a warning to some of you ) . all i can say is " maybe they 'll grow out of it . " he is not funny . his act has no bite , no point of view , no opinion / viewpoint at all . his comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to ( the " this is all happened to us " or " has this ever happened to you ? " school of humor ) . he runs about manically , acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth ( for those in the audience that may not be so good with words ) . his fans acknowledge that , yes , they can relate . " yeah ! that 's happened to me ! " " i know that reference ! ' they laugh , cheer , clap , and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit . he never actually comments on the things he discusses in any intelligent , interesting way . he has no edge . he 's not outraged by anything . he 's cute ' n ' cuddly . richard pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that cook is classified as a stand up comic . " pryor ? the guy writing this must be old ! ' okay , try this on for size : chris rock is good comedy . same with dave chappelle . carlin . laura kightlinger . kinison . rodney dangerfield . bob saget . gilbert gottfried . dom irrera . lewis black . robert klein . the late mitch hedberg . jim norton . patton oswalt . brian posehn . degeneres . jon stewart . bob & david . the ucb . i 'm not even a big fan of sarah silverman , but at least she 's trying to bring something different to the party . anything but this ! god help us . let 's hope he goes the way of carrot top and dice soon ( do n't forget , cook fans , mr. top and mr. clay were once as popular as your boy here )
2335,bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and i used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there , no hair on him or pillows or sheets . this is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair , i also used it on the tougher part of his beard . wonderful item
2336,the essence of painter francis bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life . seen through his central nervous system and eyes , we experience his world of fragments , like collage pieces of existence . the only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting . otherwise , he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being , himself , together . tellingly , one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job with his lover george in his paintings of george . however , he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with george ! that sums up bacon , his art and his life , in a nutshell . bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art . yet he is also the most alone person imaginable , something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay . one of the very best films about an artist ever made . you do n't need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here . if you want to see his paintings , you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute , or less , using any visual search engine
2337,this product simply does not produce accurate results . it skips entire lines , words on the same line , and misreads even the most legible characters . it came bundled with my scanner , so at least i did not waste my money on it . do n't waste yours
2338,i installed this on my laptop and it slowed it down to a crawl . i deinstalled it , installed norton 2005 , bought the subscription renewal and my laptop is back up to speed . you have been warne
2339,this software is wonderful ! i have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years . i 've tried broderbund ( sp ? ) whose interface was too clumsy , nova which was rather difficult at times ( many things you ca n't do ) and now this . when i first took this out of the package and installed it i thought i had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very , very few backgrounds , templates or embellishements even when i opened the xtras cds that came with this . i truly did not feel the xtras cds were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them . but then i found the tutorials that are included on the cd and watched the one about making collages . i did n't get halfway through the video - i had figured out how to do it . i have now created some of the best scrapbook pages i 've ever made . within hours i had a beautiful collage / letter to send with my holiday cards . my husband 's first impression was a heartfelt " it 's lovely " . what has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that i can take any image and make it a background , i can create and manipulate text almost any way i want , i 've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it ( .png format ) . i feel like i have no limitations on what i can do now . i imagine this software is not as sophistacated as adobe illustrator , but then it probably is n't as complicated to use ( from what i remember that program has a rather steep learning curve ) . you can also use the eyedropper tool to " pick up " any color from any picture , background , or element ( read " anything " ) in the program . i was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched ! i can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches . you can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do , but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses . you can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing , etc. there are so many more features i could n't possibly list them here , nor would you want me too ( too much time ) . if you only use premade templates and do n't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software . you could start with something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 , which i liked , and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program . you may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities . the great thing about this program is that it is n't just for scrapbooking . you can do all your photo manipulation in it . i have always liked paint shop pro so much that i have n't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6 , but i kept using that version . i 'm so glad i got version 10 as it is very user friendly too . but please know that version 10 ( which comes with this package ) is not the most recent version . version 11 is out now . if you do n't want / need the xtras cds that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files ( portable network graphics format ) or make your own . i hope you have as much fun with this software as i am having . i highly recommend the training videos on the cd - they really help
2340,i 'm biased , because i loved the movie and adore the book . gregson-williams does an outstanding job here ( before this , i was most familiar with his score work on metal gear solid videogames ) . the music is extremely touching and magical . the " evacuating london score " ( from the scene in the train station ) tugs at the heartstrings . and the " battle score " brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie 's climax . one song that 's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek . other than that absence ( probably due to copyright restrictions ) , this is an excellent cd . as for the " bonus " dvd - i probably would n't purchase it if i had a second chance . it 's got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art . there is only one trailer , and it is not the very first one released , which opens with the kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin ' with its intro of the wardrobe . there are also behind-the-scenes interviews i have n't watched yet , but i wonder if they 'll appear again when the movie dvd is released .
2341,after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .
2342,attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day . it features a stellar cast including powers boothe as a crafty roman leader who tries to use attila to gain possession of rome . gerard butler is attila , the hun , and he is everything about attila in this role , never was an actor better suited . his character is sharp , passionate , determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film . he brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with boothe even more dynamic . this is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes
2343,i used huggies pullups with my older child and started using them with my younger one . when they came out with dora on the easy ups and our grocery store had a huge dora display , my daughter had to use dora not the pullups which have the disney princess design which she is not that into ( i personally think the disney princesses are not a good choice for potty training age 2-3 year olds , i would assume that dora would be picked by more children that age ) . first off the smallest size they have is big for the average 2-3 year old . they did have a size 2t but from what i have seen it has been discountined . i do n't know if it is because they are a little big or the quality they do leak . i have never had a huggies pullup leak on me but these easy have on a regular basis . the design definetly got my daughter not wanting diapers and on the road to potty training but the leakage did n't make it easy for me . i would never use these for overnight use , pullups absorb so much better in an overnight situation . now if pampaers could make a better product or huggies could make a better design then i would be happy
2344,when we tried to play the item on our dvd player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it . we ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer , which worked properly . i am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded . i can see deducting shipping and handling . but , a restocking charge - - that is outrageous ! the merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it ! please remind me not to buy from amazon.com
2345,very easy to follow - especially if you 've used quicken in the past . reports are set up just a little bit different - total at top of category instead of bottom , so you need to get accustomed to that ; overall great produc
2346,. . .uninspired and unsatisying . the writing style is austinesque , but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not . margaret 's motives and emotions are obscure , and the author 's assertion that her & quot ; heroine&quot ; has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed . quite the contrary . .
2347,this software came with a scanner i recently purchased and i decided to upgrade from the " se " ( striped edition ? ) that was bundled with the device . considering the cost and what the software can do it is an amazing value . by simply using this software to re-create documents instead of retyping them is saving me more an hour or two a day . i was hesitant to puchse it based upon all the recent negative reviews , but decided with the 30 day refund policy i could try it risk free . i 'm glad i did . the software worked flawlessly for me - even on 5th and 6th generation copies that were hard to read with my naked eye ( and i do n't need or wear glasses ) . i 'm not sure what those people that were scanning books were trying to accomplish , but when i scanned some pages from an encyclopedia for my son the ocr worked great ! try it and if it does n't work then return it .
2348,i liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer.. . is that logical at all ? ? the senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father ? if he had the senator when he was twenty he 'd have to be 77. is it really reasonable that he 's running around killing people , and setting houses on fire . it was a very unlikely twist to the end . it still was a good book
2349,i used this to help plan kitchen and bathroom makeovers . it helped me see just what we wanted
2350,very clear , bright day , strong magnification quality seems to be good . very well priced at around $100.00.i will know more over the passage of time .my firstimpression is good mj schra
2351,undoubtedly , marnie belongs to the top list of bernard herrmann 's best film scores , a wonderful musical image of alfred hitchcock 's underrated movie . written for small ensemble ( strings , woods , harp and horns ) herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood , tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for hitch . joel mcneely 's reading is simply stunning as ever , so is the performance , but i just do n't like the overall acoustics on these varèse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details . they simply are overheard in this muffled sound . this is far from ideal for recording a film score and i bet herrmann would not have liked this ! but , it 's a great , great score
2352,this camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio , however , i was unable to make copies for back-up or to share with family members . i took it back and bought a mini-dv camcorder as i was told it was easier to make copies . this has yet to be tested
2353,as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is , this production was a waste of time , space and money . everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves . the acting is bad , the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff do n't stink...which it does-badly . it 's not the worse movie i 've seen , but it 's surprisingly close . please do n't waste your time with this film
2354,according to charles kimball , religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth . religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests , while at the same time , more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution . using a comparative religious approach , kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil . kimball argues the word ` religion ' is amorphous and difficult to define . as a result , the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary , one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions . kimball , next , asks if religion is the cause of evil , and he answers both yes and no . a religion that is arrogant , condescending , and requires adherents to " disconnect their brain " is problematic . on the other hand , religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community . kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil . the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims . when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine , the propensity towards evil increases dramatically . sacred texts , sources of wisdom and guidance , become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims . christianity and islam have missionary mandates , but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims . kimball argues for a " human view of truth " , one that is dynamic and relational , allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions . another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience : when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities . when a charismatic leader demands total obedience , has unrestricted power , and has total control , religion is unhealthy . uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy , as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection . strict segregation from the larger society , combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous . kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence . every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth , while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future . when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time , the likelihood for disaster increases . many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society , zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status , and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind . kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god 's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous . religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means : when one theological component gets elevated , thus becoming an end , and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end . all religions have notions of sacred space , but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space . reinforcing or protecting group identity against an ` other ' , or protecting group identity from within the group , are also potentially dangerous signs . institutional structures develop in all religious traditions , but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end . kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends . the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a " holy " war . kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity , and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990-91. islam is a peaceful religion , which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order . the word jihad means " struggling in the way of god , " but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the christian just war theory . because of socio-economic disparities , some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends , and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause . kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy . with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil , religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis . faith , hope , and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents , so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted . against secularism , kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards , and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity . with religious diversity christians have three options , exclusivism , inclusivism , and pluralism , but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity . finally , the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community : if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab-israeli-palestinian conflict , then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak
2355,the best of taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. the albums consisted of two studio albums & quot ; taste&quot ; , & quot ; on the boards , and the two live albums & quot ; live taste&quot ; , and & quot ; live at the isle of wight&quot ; . this band was a power trio led by rory gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career . the band led by gallagher on vocals , guitar ( electric , acoustic , & amp ; slide ) , harmonica , and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock . the music has much in common with cream . however , the richard mccracken and john wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of jack bruce and ginger baker . the undervalued gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of eric clapton . like cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like & quot ; sugar mama&quot ; and & quot ; i feel good&quot ; included here . the music included here is varied . it ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of & quot ; catfish&quot ; to the more acoustic cover of & quot ; leavin ' blues&quot ; . the cuts from & quot ; on the boards&quot ; become more jazzy at times . tracks like & quot ; on the boards&quot ; and & quot ; it 's happenened before , it 'll happen again&quot ; highlight the band 's more improvisational approach . hard hitting tracks like & quot ; eat my words&quot ; spotlight gallagher 's outstanding slide technique . two cuts i miss from this period which are not included here are & quot ; dual carriageway pain&quot ; from & quot ; taste , and & quot ; morning sun&quot ; from & quot ; on the boards&quot ; . the live concert favorite & quot ; sinner boy&quot ; provides a bridge to gallagher 's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album & quot ; rory gallagher&quot ; . this anthology provides a great overview of the early work of irish blues-rock guitar hero rory gallagher and his battered stratocaster . it is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports
2356,this was sent to my daughter and son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit . i had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up . they love it ! ! ! not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap , shampoo , etc. , my son-in-law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well
2357,i found the first book , faerie wars , pretty interesting so i decided to read this one . in many ways it had excellent qualities such as suspense , mystery and a bit of romance . i 'll have to admit , i finished the book pretty quickly because i got hooked onto it and did n't want to put it down . there were many twists and turns of the plot , and it was practically impossible to guess what would happen next at times . i did , however , find the ending a tad abrupt . it was such a shame to finish the book without any more information on pyrgus , mr. fogarty , henry or blue . but overall the book was an excellent one.... . it will certainly capture your interest
2358,this film released in late 1984 , is about a married man named rob salinger ( the late dudley moore ) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage . rob is a newspaper editor married to micheline " micki " salinger ( ann reinking ) , a judge . while secretly romancing maude ( amy irving ) , he proposes to her ( maude ) . rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes , they ( the women ) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages . but rob keeps both wives . in the real world , bigamy is undoubtedly illegal . director blake edwards ' previous film credits include breakfast at tiffany 's and the pink panther . subsequently , he directed the late john ritter in 1989 's skin deep
2359,i am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon . trust me , i am not someone who claims to be a music expert , but i am a big fan of jam / funk and jazz fusion . i play bass , i understand music , and umphrey 's is among my favorite bands ( others include 311 , widespread panic , deep banana blackout , red hot chili peppers , soulive , medeski martin wood ) . in general i am open to all kinds of funky music , and umphrey 's usually puts out . in my opinion , this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk ( following the red hot chili peppers and 311 ) . with this album i was expecting them to develop their sound from anchor drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like rhcp 's blood sex sugar magic did , while staying true to their unique roots in jazz , blues , rock and even some metal . like i said , they fuse genres like no one else can...this album , however , was a complete failure in the areas i have described above . first off , i can understand how reviewers point to the production quality , and the musical talent displayed throughout the album . umphreys mcgee is insanely talented , and no effort could hide that from the listener . however , to be blunt this album is boring as hell , has no funk or rock in it period , and is frankly somewhat depressing . if your expecting wild guitar improv , explosive beats and fun , uplifting music- -ignore this album . if you are a fan of umphrey 's live show and their past albums- -ignore this album . if you tend to be willing to overlook production quality in search of funkier , jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation- -do not buy this album . the only way i can summate this album is that its a typical indy type album . slow songs without enough music , little variance from song to song , depressing lyrics , and a slow pace . some say this is umphreys showing their full range , i say this is them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is not all that enjoyable . the only reason i wrote this review is that im amazed by the other reviews on this page . i wish i had never heard this album , it is a pathetic effort from a band as experimental and fun as umphreys mcgee . they missed a golden opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation , this album is a step in the wrong direction . i strong advise the listener who likes to be entertained by music , rather than production quality and introspective lyrics , to steer way clear of this album . this was a massive dissappointment beyond any album release i have ever heard ( including by the way from rhcp , which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to safety in numbers )
2360,this was just a boring movie...ca n't understand the other review 's saying it 's good . would n't reccomend it
2361,in seeking to develop my own grant writing course , i reviewed 20 books on amazon . i was sold on this one by its extremely high amazon.com sales rank...probably the highest of this category . nevertheless , i was shocked and taken aback by a comment on the introduction page , that harkened back to my eighth-grader days : " you 'll learn that in grant writing you especially need to cultivate two abilities : meeting deadlines and following directions . " despite the obvious comprehensiveness of the materials presented in the book from ms burke-smith 's experience , i do n't know who 's responsible for the talking-down attitude presented here . this is my first everything title , and i do n't know if all everything titles are like this , or if it 's from award-winning business writer ms tremore . all i know is after getting such an introduction , what reader would wish to proceed into the book 's depths with that kind of attitude by one 's hoped-for mentors ?
2362,very easy to use and provides a very wide range of cards and other items . excellent product . dav
2363,i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e. same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product
2364,of course , no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that dizzy could . his trumpet can only be described as hot , and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air . this man 's music has life in it . unfortunately , the real energy to dizzy is in his latin jazz work , and a more complete compilation of that style would be the compact jazz series . ken burns ' collection here is more versatile , but just not as lively as dizzy 's music can be . proceed with caution
2365,this is the best album / band noones ever heard of . this is the most underrated bands ever ( including fm static . ) and they deserve some appreciation . this cd is a great rock cd and it has a bit of seemingly hip-hop bits here and there in just about every song . almost every song on this cd rocks , so buy it
2366,i use this program daily and it is awesome ! it has lots of great new features especially the new home page that has the customer , vendor and employee centers where you can now see all of the information in one place . the features and functionality of the program are everything any small to mid size business needs to run their company from a financial point of view . great improvements over previous versions
2367,i had this model , or at least it looked the same , for a few years and it worked exceptionally well . it finally broke down recently and i thought i was lucky enough to find it again , but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all . actually , it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done , which , of course is like not having it done at all
2368,there are not many movies i have switched off after the first 30 minutes , but this is one of them , and i recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise
2369,have tried about six times to install it . i 've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice , all to no avail . it says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings . it tells you to check the log . well , there are over 85k entries and even if i found the errors i do n't see any way to correct the errors . when i try to run it i get " starter mfc application has encountered a problem and needs to close " . i 'll be returning this puppy to amazon for a replacement
2370,darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games . to make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy , basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease , and the darkbasic renderer looks very , very ugly . however , basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with . if you 're trying to get into serious game development , learn c++ and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx , or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source . and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math
2371,i must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of shakespear 's world and plays . they are very good and intertaining but i must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations ( in detail ) of people having sex . the book is probably very good if you like reading text books , and do n't mind these pictures , but i was just too grossed out . if you are teaching lit in college and / or studying shakespeare , this is probably the book that you should use , but you should flip through the book first ( i.e : library , book store ) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves .
2372,when i hear the alarm go off and the opening strains of henry mancini 's piano creep in , i know i 'm preparing for that journey into the best alcohol induced haze of the 80s on the " crawford memorial interstate-81 " . stops along the way include.. . adoption wars birthday exploitation unfair life being let go rose rage raw ( rare ) steak one award taking that special exit for " wire hanger etiquette " christmas propaganda chadwick , love , and a snitch near death experience banishment making up soft drink wars loss new beginnings new losses last moments and last words before taking that final exit back to reality . in a world filled with " f*** me " heels , booze , domestic disputes and the biggest taboo of them all , " wire hangers " ... we all know she 's a movie star , she a bitch , she dresses well and she 's rich . ( quoting john waters ) i 've watched this so many times that i need therapy
2373,this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .
2374,hacker 's challenge 2 is a sort of practical exam for the hacking exposed series . hacker 's challenge was a terrific book for putting some incident response and forensic skills to use and practicing for the real thing . hacker 's challenge 2 continues the tradition and should be a must read for anyone who works with network security and incident response . the style of the challenges is fairly entertaining and the plots are so engaging you may not want to put the book down . its like a best-selling mystery novel for network security techies . it may not affect the quality of the book overall , but i preferred having the authors of the individual challenges identified as they were in hacker 's challenge . however , you should definitely buy this book ! ( ...
2375,the original " candyman " sucks so bad , but everybody praises it and i kept wondering to myself , " am i missing something ? " so , i tried watching it again and it still sucked as i could not even get through it , so i figured maybe i should watch the sequels and maybe i would find something that i liked about this series . well , after watching " candyman 2 " , one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish...again , the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme . the villain in " candyman " makes me want to laugh because he is so not scary...if you want a good laugh , watch the " candyman " series , but if you want to be scared , you would even do better to watch " ren and stimpy " . in all seriousness , watch " halloween " and " halloween ii " if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and does n't try to send a social message . lol . some people call " candyman 2 - farewell to the flesh " a horror movie...i just call it rubbish
2376,while i think the basics of the book are good , i do n't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option . i did much better on the south beach diet , where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods . fat is what makes us feel satisfied . after years of trying to diet by limiting fat , it was a revelation to me i could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived . an omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary . secondly , many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat . i just noticed this week that cool whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it 's top ingredients . this ca n't be better for you than actual cream . i also prefer the book " french woman do n't get fat " , which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good , natural food when it 's in season . the pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle . i feel that the g.i diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before . i think this book is about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated . it certainly can help get people on the right track , but i think there are better books available .
2377,i tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when i could n't get a consistent reading . the temperatures were so varied it was completely useless ! ! very disappointed ! ! i returned it without even the box
2378,fantastic , a great product , especially considering the price . i love the size . i love that the height is adjustable . it is exactly what i wanted , and i am thrilled with it .
2379,i like machine head a lot . many people disliked " the burning red " and called them sell-outs , but i appreciated the effort to make something different . then came " supercharger " . i have listened to it a dozen times , looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it . it never came . this is a bad cd by a great band .
2380,this cd provides a fantastic overview of rypdal , who has been recording for ecm for 30+ years now . the tracks range from pieces with an & quot ; electric miles&quot ; sound to an orchestrated track . while very diverse , the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique , atmospheric tone and excellent compositions . the infamous ecm sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering . informative liner notes as well . highly recommended
2381,i like funny rappers who have some talent at least . i do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all . and even the people that i know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they do n't like it at all by the third time . truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke . avoid this one
